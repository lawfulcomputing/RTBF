and the complainant's e-mail addresses from all lists for sending commercial communications and stopped
processing of his personal data for marketing purposes. The accused further stated that she had done so
an internal investigation which verified that she had not received any request for annulment from the complainant
sending commercial communications or deleting the complainant's personal data. On November 25, 2020
however, the complainant turned to the Office again, stating that, despite the above, he was from
The accused is re-contacted with the business offer via SMS sent
on 25 November 2020 to his telephone number.
 
(3) In view of the above, the administrative body of the first instance initiated proceedings in the matter
on offense, by order ref. UOOU-03580 / 20-9 of 14 January 2021, which was
a misdemeanor has been established pursuant to § 62 para. c) of Act No. 110/2019 Coll., for which
a fine of CZK 20,000 was imposed on the accused. However, on the basis of timely resistance, he was
the said order in accordance with § 150 paragraph 3 of Act No. 500/2004 Coll. canceled and was pending
continued.
 
 (4) The result of the ongoing proceedings on the offense was the issuance of a decision no. UOOU-03580 / 20-
14 of 1 February 2021 ('the decision') by which the accused was again found guilty of
committing an offense according to § 62 par. 1 let. c) of Act No. 110/2019 Coll. and was fined
this time, however, in the amount of CZK 2,000, as it violated some of the data subject's rights under Article 12
to 22 of the General Regulation, which she committed as a controller of personal data by
complainant's deletion of personal data of 29 June 2020 continues to him via SMS
messages sent on 19 August 2020 and 25 November 2020 to his telephone number XXXXXX

delete the personal data concerning the data subject concerned if the data subject so requests
objections to processing pursuant to Article 21 (2) of the General Regulation.
 
 (5) However, the accused objected to the decision in due course.

  Decomposition content

(6) In the appeal, the accused stated above all that she did not agree with the imposed administrative penalty.
In particular, the accused should have taken all measures in accordance with the general regulation in relation to
to the complainant's personal data. Furthermore, as she recalled, the complainant's personal data were at
on the basis of his request deleted from its automated systems, which he uses for sending
advertising messages via SMS messages, ie for direct marketing. To repeat
the sending of a commercial communication to the complainant should then have taken place only by coincidence, resp. consequence
human error, when the accused, for operational reasons, had the commercial message sent manually,
without the use of automated systems.
 
(7) The accused further points to the mitigating circumstance that economic reality should be
associated with the global pandemic associated with the spread of SARS-CoV-2, for which it was
the state of the Czech Republic has repeatedly declared a state of emergency. As a result of this situation, he perceives
accused a fine of CZK 2,000 as liquidation and considers that in such
In this case, there is room for imposing an administrative penalty by reprimand pursuant to Section 45 of the Act
No. 250/2016 Coll., on liability for misdemeanors and proceedings on them. It should also be the case
space for consideration of waiving the imposition of an administrative penalty pursuant to Section 43 (2) of the Act
No. 250/2016 Coll., as in addition to the above already during the discussion of the subject

 

2/5

The defendant took steps to prevent similar mistakes in the future
infringement.
  
(8) Finally, the accused drew attention to the ambiguities in the operative part of the decision.

(9) Article 17 (1) of the General Regulation is worded as follows:

  Applicable law

"The data subject has the right to have the controller delete personal data without undue delay,
concerning the data subject and the controller has a duty of personal data without undue delay
deferred if, for one of the following reasons:

(a) the personal data are no longer needed for the purposes for which they were collected or otherwise

processed;

(b) the data subject withdraws the consent on the basis of which the data referred to in Article 6 (1) (a) were and)
or Article 9 (2) (a) (a) processed, and there is no other legal reason for
processing;

(c) the data subject objects to the processing referred to in Article 21 (1) and there are none
overriding legitimate reasons for the processing or the data subject objects
processing in accordance with Article 21 (2);

(d) the personal data have been processed unlawfully;

(e) personal data must be deleted in order to comply with a legal obligation laid down in Union law

or the Member State to which the administrator applies;

f) personal data has been collected in connection with the provision of information society services

pursuant to Article 8 (1).

(10) Article 21 of the General Regulation is worded as follows:

„1. The data subject has the right to object at any time for reasons related to his or her specific situation
against the processing of personal data concerning him, pursuant to Article 6 (1) (a) e) or f),
including profiling based on these provisions. Administrator personal data further
does not process unless it demonstrates compelling overriding reasons for processing
over the interests or rights and freedoms of the data subject, or for the determination, exercise or defense
legal claims.

2. Where personal data are processed for direct marketing purposes, the data subject shall have the right
to object at any time to the processing of personal data concerning him for this purpose
marketing, which includes profiling as far as this direct marketing is concerned.

3. If the data subject objects to processing for direct marketing purposes,
personal data will no longer be processed for these purposes.

4. The data subject shall be explicitly informed of the right referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 and that right shall be
clearly and separately from any other information, at the latest at the time of the first
communication with the data subject.

 

3/5

5. In connection with the use of information society services, and without prejudice to the Directive
2002/58 / EC, the data subject may exercise his right to object by automated means
means using technical specifications.

6. If personal data are processed for the purposes of scientific or historical research or for
statistical purposes under Article 89 (1), the data subject shall, for reasons relating to his specific
situation, the right to object to the processing of personal data concerning him, unless it is
processing necessary for the performance of a task carried out for reasons of public interest. "

 

(11) Provisions of § 62 par. 1 let. c) of Act No. 110/2019 Coll. reads:

"A controller or processor under Title II commits an offense by:. c) violates some
from the rights of the data subject under Articles 12 to 22 of Regulation (EU)
2016/679 or Title II. "

 Assessment by a second instance body

(12) On the basis of the appeal lodged, the appellate body examined the contested decision in its entirety
scope, including the process that preceded its publication and first dealt with argumentation
accused.

(13) In particular, he found that the alleged irregularities, resp. obvious inaccuracies in
of the decision were in accordance with the provisions of Section 70 of Act No. 500/2004 Coll. removed
by issuing a corrective decision of the Office ref. UOOU-03580 / 20-18 of 17 March 2021.

(14) The Appellate Body further rejected the defendant's assertion that all should have been made
measures in connection with the deletion of the complainant's personal data. Even if they are really personal
it erased the complainant's data from all automated systems, as claimed in its statement
of 9 October 2020, sent on the basis of a notification from the Office dated 16 September 2020,
this did not result in the consistent destruction of the complainant's personal data and the termination of their processing,
as the accused complainant contacted the commercial communication again on 25 November
2020. For the alleged "human error" in the sense of the provisions of § 20 paragraphs 1 and 2 of the Act
No. 250/2016 Coll. fully accused of the accused, who, moreover, cannot be released from liability for
offense pursuant to Section 21, Paragraph 1 of Act No. 250/2016 Coll., as she clearly did not make every effort,
which could be required to prevent the offense. Pursuant to Article 4 (2) of the General Regulation
processing means any operation with personal data, with or without assistance
automated systems, the general regulation covering in whole or in part
automated processing of personal data and non - automated processing of personal data
data contained in or to be included in the register (Article 2 (1) of the General Agreement)
ordinance). The processing of personal data therefore also includes the manual sending of commercial communications
via SMS messages, as performed by the accused in the treated case. From above
For these reasons, the matter cannot be resolved by reprimanding or waiving the sanction.
 
(15) After an overall examination, the Appellate Body then found that in the administrative procedure
no irregularities were found to render the decision unlawful.
In particular, the amount of the fine imposed at the very lower limit of the rate seems appropriate to him and which
therefore, it cannot be considered a priori liquidation. She could have been responsible for the offense in question
a fine of up to EUR 20 000 000 or up to 4% of the total annual turnover is imposed

 

4/5

(Article 83 (5) of the General Regulation). In addition, the decision significantly reduced the amount of the fine
originally saved by command no. UOOU-03580 / 20-9 of 14 January 2021. In this regard
the appellate body also recalls that the accused did not substantiate its specific financial situation
(see Resolution of the Enlarged Senate of the Supreme Administrative Court No. 1 As 9 / 2008-133 of
April 20, 2010, where it states: “It will therefore be up to the party to decide whether to do so
his interest in ensuring that the fine imposed on him did not have liquidating consequences for him by
provide the authority with basic information about his personal and property situation and these as well
prove or enable the administrative authority to verify their veracity in a credible manner ’).
 
(16) For all the above reasons, the Appellate Body therefore ruled as set out in
opinion of this Decision.
 

Lessons learned:

Pursuant to the provisions of Section 91 (1) of the Act, this decision shall be challenged
No. 500/2004 Coll., Administrative Procedure Code, cannot be revoked.
