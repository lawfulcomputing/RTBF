committed offenses under § 62 para. b) and § 62 par. 1 let. c) of the Act

Regulation (EU) 2016/679). The amount of the fine imposed was the administrative body of the first instance
compared to the amount stated in the order reduced by CZK 30,000, ie to CZK 120,000.

[7] The administrative body of first instance concluded in its decision that the accused
demonstrably has no legal title to the processing of personal data pursuant to Article 6 (1)
Regulation (EU) 2016/679, as it does not have the consent of the entity to which it is published
(and the defendant further used) personal data within the meaning of Article 6 (1) (a) (a) of the Regulation
(EU) 2016/67, and other legal titles of processing that would theoretically be possible

paragraph 1 (a) (f) Regulation (EU) 2016/679, or the processing of personal data in public

2/5

of the contested decision. A deadline of 10 days from delivery was set for supplementing the submission
the above challenges. However, the defendant's lawyer did not file a deadline within the time limit
did not complete.

  Assessment by a second instance body

[12] Given that the lawyer of the accused company objected to the merits
the irregularity was not substantiated in any way and no objections were raised,
the contested decision, as well as the proceedings which preceded it, were considered by the Board of Appeal
authority only in terms of its compliance with legal regulations, in the sense of the provisions of § 89
paragraph 2 of the Administrative Procedure Code.

[13] The Appellate Body concluded that both the contested decision and the procedure which it issued
were in accordance with the law and that this decision was also taken
duly substantiated by the administrative authority of the first instance.

[14] The Appellate Body agrees with the legal opinion of the first instance administrative body
stated in the operative part of the contested decision, namely that the defendant did not have
no legal title under the provisions of Article 6 (1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 to
processing of personal data in relation to the use of personal data obtained from public
registers for the purpose of offering trade or services, as the necessity of such
processing that would take precedence over interests or fundamental rights and freedoms
data subject requiring the protection of personal data has not been demonstrated. Even if perhaps accused
this legal title testified, it was her duty to the personal data of the data subject after him
do not further process the opposition unless it demonstrates compelling legitimate reasons
for such processing as would outweigh the interests or rights and freedoms
the data subject, or the reasons for determining, enforcing or defending legal claims,
in accordance with Article 21 (1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.

[15] The Appellate Body also agrees that it is not possible in this case either
processing of the complainant's personal data in the public interest pursuant to Article 6 (1) (a) E)
Regulation (EU) 2016/679, as the accused is not empowered by a special legal
regulation or law of the European Union, as required by Article 6 (3) of Regulation (EU)
2016/679.

[16] Consent within the meaning of Article 6 (1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 to extract its data
from public industrial rights databases for the purpose of offering industrial registration
rights on the site accused by the complainant in his objection to the processing of personal
data pursuant to Article 21 (1) (EU) 2016/679.

[17] As regards the possible application of the legal title under Article 6 (1) (a). b) Regulation (EU)
2016/679 in relation to the "registration" of an international patent by the complainant appellate body
states that this legal title for processing was not provided in any way by the accused,
although proof of legal title is the responsibility of the administrator.

[18] It is also evident that the accused infringed the data subject's right under Article 12 (3)
Regulation (EU) 2016/679, as the complainant, following his objection to processing in
within the meaning of Article 21 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, has not informed the
resp. it has not substantiated this fact with the Office.

 

3/5

[19] As regards the amount of the fine imposed, the Appellate Body finds that since the amount charged
did not object to the fines imposed and they were imposed in accordance with
he found no reason to change it. In this context, the Appellate Body finds that
that an administrative proceeding had already been conducted with the accused in the past, in which she was accused
obligations under Article 12 (3) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 by the administrative authority of the first
degree by order no. UOOU-02999 / 20-3 of 28 August 2020 imposed a fine of
CZK 50,000.

 

and another administrative offense has been abandoned and used

[20] In addition to the above, the Appellate Body adds that from the order of the Enlarged Chamber
Of the Supreme Administrative Court of 20 April 2010, No. 1 As 9/2008 - 133, it follows that
that: 'It will therefore be for the party concerned to show that it has an interest in
that the fine imposed on it does not have liquidating consequences for it, by giving the administrative authority
will provide basic information about their personal and property relations and these as well
provide evidence or allow the administrative authority to verify
their
In the opinion of the enlarged Senate of the Supreme Administrative Court mentioned above
in the above-mentioned resolution, exceptions may also be granted in exceptional circumstances
prohibition of the liquidation nature of fines imposed for other legal offenses
persons. (Note Act No. 250/2016 Coll., On liability for misdemeanors and proceedings on them,
the concept of administrative tort and thus
only
term "offense.)" This will be the case for particularly serious administrative offenses committed
legal persons, or in a situation where the legal person has serious administrative
offenses repeatedly and previous less severe sanctions have proved ineffective, or
in cases where the legal person itself has in fact been established for the purpose of implementation
illegal activities, and there is thus a very strong public interest in making this legal
the person no longer operated in the given field of activity, and at the same time according to the relevant legal regulation
it is not possible to impose a prohibition or other penalty on a legal person for a given administrative offense
punishment having equivalent effect. "
Regarding the property relations, the accused can be stated that they are not on the www.justice.cz portal
to date, no accounting records are available to the accused, although to her, such as
an entity registered in the Commercial Register is subject to the obligation to file an accountant
financial statements to the collection of documents pursuant to Section 21a of Act No. 563/1991 Coll., on related accounting
with § 66 of Act No. 304/2013 Coll., on public registers of legal and natural persons
and on the registration of trust funds.
Only the amount of registered capital (CZK 1,000) is stated here, but this information is not available

Only the documents have the meaning of the accused
financial statements according to § 18 of Act No. 563/1991 Coll., on accounting - balance sheet, statement
profit and loss and the notes to the financial statements, which explain and supplement the information
contained in the balance sheet and profit and loss account.

[21] In conclusion, the Appellate Body did not find the contested decision
illegal and did not find any errors in the procedure prior to the issue
of this Decision. The legal conclusions of the first instance administrative body were correct
justified and in accordance with the relevant legislation.

[22] On the basis of all the above, the Appellate Body therefore decided that
