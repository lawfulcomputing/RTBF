Trading company and service provider


The inspection was initiated on the basis of a complaint in which it was stated that the company did not provide the complainant with information about the processing of his personal data. As soon as he exercised his right to be forgotten (deleted from the company's records), the company did not respond to this fact, or transferred this right to the data subject himself leading to his active deletion of his own personal data. The aim of the investigation was to find out whether the company complies with the obligations set by the general regulation when processing personal data. Thus, the office checked on the spot whether the company processes personal data in accordance with the general regulation, whether data subjects have easy access to comprehensible information regarding the processing of their personal data and whether their rights arising from the general regulation are respected. Related processing relationships and the state of technical and organizational security of personal data processing were checked. The inspectors found that the company violated the general regulation in the area of rights of data subjects (correction and erasure), as it delegated its obligations arising from the general regulation to the data subjects themselves, and also the internal regulations governing the fulfillment of the rights of data subjects were in conflict with the general regulation. In other areas no violation of the general regulation was found during this inspection.
