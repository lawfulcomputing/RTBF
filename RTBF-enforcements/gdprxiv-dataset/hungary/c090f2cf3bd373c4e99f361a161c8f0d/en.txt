III. Decision
In the present proceedings, the Authority shall issue a decision on 25 May 2018 regarding the data processing of the Debtor
did not examine previous data processing and the processing of submitted requests from data subjects.
This is due to the application of the General Data Protection Regulation to these data processing
took place before the starting date and are therefore subject to the rules of the General Data Protection Regulation
are not applicable, so they are subject to the Authority's data protection authority proceedings
no application may be made or, in the case of the data processing objected to, the general
the Authority does not have the power to examine compliance with the provisions of the Data Protection Regulation
in the context of this data protection authority procedure. In this regard, the Authority shall:
and the Applicant by performing the loan agreement No. […] dated 26 November 2007
nor did it make any findings regarding the related data management. The Authority also has competence
in its absence, it may not examine the issue of the validity or invalidity of the loan agreement,
it therefore considered it valid in the absence of a court decision to the contrary.
III. 1. Transmission of personal data of the Applicant
According to the Debtor's statement, the legal basis for the transfer of the Applicant's personal data is the Civil Code. 6: 193.
§ of the Hpt. Section 161 (1) (c), Article 6 (1) (b) of the General Data Protection Regulation
and the loan agreement concluded between him and […] on 26 November 2007,
and there was a legitimate interest within the meaning of Article 6 (1) (f) of the General Data Protection Regulation.
The Authority finds that Article 6 (1) (b) of the General Data Protection Regulation
The legal basis under this Regulation is only applicable if the processing is for the performance of a contract
necessary in which one of the parties is concerned. Therefore, this plea cannot be extended
data processing to which the data subject is not a party, on the one hand, and certain pre-contractual
data processing for which the data subject fails to perform the contract
from the normal duty of cooperation of the Contracting Parties to remedy the situation
necessary steps to be taken. The performance of the contract may also include those a
steps when the data controller who concluded the contract with the data subject - that is, who is in the contract
the other party - in the event of a delay in performance, calls on the person concerned to perform. However, the general
no longer the contractual basis under Article 6 (1) (b) of the Data Protection Regulation
may be applied in the event that the controller is liable to the data subject for non-performance
assigns its claim to a debt collection company (ie the problem has already been
out of contract). Legal basis for the transfer in the context of a transfer
thus, only another claim, typically on the part of the assignor, against the customer
may have a legitimate interest in selling or enforcing an overdue claim.
According to the justification attached to the Civil Code, the transfer of claims is the same as the transfer of ownership
it is based on logic, so the assignment is in fact nothing more than a claim
transfer of ownership. The assignment separates the claim from the original legal relationship,
from which it is derived, and the assignee is solely the claim and not the fundamental relationship
replaces the assignor. By assigning the claim

14

separates from the fundamental relationship and the assignee becomes the holder of the claim, the
the concessionaire's enforcement and the related data management are no longer valid
in order to perform the contract from which the claim originally arose, since in this
In that case, the assignee would have to assert it not for his own benefit but for the benefit of the assignor
a claim acquired by assignment. With the assignment, if the consideration
the assignor’s claim against the obligor is entirely contingent on the purchase price
or partially recouped. Sale of the assignor's claim on the customer
other third parties, such as a debt management company, and
the legitimate interest of the assignor and not the underlying
for the performance of the contract, as the claim becomes independent of the assignment
from the contract.
As he had transferred his claim against the Applicant by way of a Compulsory Assignment, and
inherent in the transfer of the Applicant's personal data to […], the transfer of data
As stated above, its legal basis cannot be Article 6 (1) (b) of the General Data Protection Regulation
contractual legal basis. The Authority further notes that due to the details detailed above
legal basis for assignment is excluded not only in the present case but also in principle.
However, this does not necessarily mean that the Debtor had no legal basis a
Transfer of personal data of an applicant as permitted by law
and to enforce a lawfully transferred claim, and
there was a legitimate interest in the transfer of the personal data necessary for that purpose
in principle.
The Debtor relied on the Hpt. Section 161 (1)
paragraph c) and the Civil Code. 6: 193. § as well.
According to the Authority, Hpt. Section 161 (1) (c) shall not be considered personal
as a separate legal basis for the transfer of data, given that this legal provision
does not include mandatory data processing, but merely allows the financial institution to
issue a bank secret to a third party if you have an interest in claiming it from the customer
to sell or enforce an overdue claim. However, this does not qualify
a legal obligation that would create an independent legal basis, as Infotv. Section 5 (3)
the law should also regulate the conditions for data processing. Instead
a Hpt. Section 161 (1) (c) provides that the data controller is entitled to data processing based on a legitimate interest
interest and the purpose of the data processing, for which the data controller needs
also take further steps to weigh up the interests. Consequently, by the Debtor
The legal provisions referred to do not constitute a transfer of the Applicant's personal data
appropriate legal basis.
The Civil Code. Defendant referred to in 6: 193. § contains the concept of assignment, which is
cannot be interpreted as a legal basis for the transfer of data. The Civil Code. 6: 196. However, according to §
the assignor is obliged to have in his possession, proving the existence of the claim - the debtor is personal
hand over the documents containing the data to the concessionaire. In the case of the Applicant, this means
that the Debtor entered into a loan agreement with the Applicant on 26 November 2007 and in it
was obliged to provide the personal data of the applicants provided to […]. It must be emphasized
however, that the Debtor to the Applicant is included only in this Loan Agreement
personal data - name, mother's name, place and time of birth, identity card number,
address, details of the terms of the loan, type of vehicle, chassis number,
engine number, registration number, purchase price - you could transfer other personal data of […].
however, not. A Hpt. In view of the findings written to Section 161 (1) (c), this
In this case, it should be taken into account that the Civil Code. does not specify the details of data management. The Civil Code.
6: 196. § does not allow for the transfer of documents - and the personal data contained therein -

15

but it appears as an obligation, so the legislator is declaring a legitimate interest
He also acknowledged the need for the transfer of data and documents.
The data subject invoked Article 6 (1) of the General Data Protection Regulation as the legal basis for the transfer.
the legal basis of a legitimate interest under paragraph 1 (f). This is supported by two balances of interest
sent a test, which, however, is not personal data related to the transfer of claims
but for contact and contact data management purposes.
It follows that, although the Debtor also relied on the legal basis of the legitimate interest, in support of it
did not carry out a balance of interests, did not specify the purpose of the data transfer, the data subject
personal data, the extent to which the transfer of personal data is necessary. THE
Debtor did not compare the interest that can be realized through its own data management and data transfer
the rights and interests of the data subject and the Applicant, did not carry out a weighting between them and
priority over the rights and interests of the data subjects and the Applicant.
In particular, the Debtor has not proved that in the specific case of the Applicant the
the transfer of data is actually necessary for the protection of the personal data of the Applicant
proportionate to its interests and fundamental rights and freedoms.
Based on the principle of accountability, data controllers must do so throughout the data processing process
implement data management operations to be able to comply with data protection rules
to demonstrate compliance. The principle of accountability, so not just in general, at the process level
interpretable, all specific data processing activities, the personal data of a specific data subject
also applies to the management of
The data controller is responsible for the lawfulness of the data processing carried out by him. The general privacy policy
due to the nature of the legal basis under Article 6 (1) (f)
whoever invokes this plea must be able to indicate precisely that it is a specific personal data
which legitimate interest of the controller is justified and why it is necessary in view of that interest
the data processing must also be able to prove and prove that the data subject has priority
legitimate interest in the protection of personal data.
In the present case, as a legal basis for data processing and the transfer of the Applicant's personal data
the legal basis indicated and the need for the transfer of data on the basis of it is in the interest of the Applicant
in the absence of a verifiable comparison, the Debtor did not comply with the general data protection regulation
The principle of accountability under Article 5 (2).
In view of the fact that the Debtor did not compare the personal data of the Applicant in a verifiable manner
the interests of the Applicant, the Authority found of its own motion that the
that the Debtor has not fulfilled any additional obligations necessary for the lawfulness of the data transfer
in particular, the Applicant was not informed by the General Data Protection Regulation
On the right to object under Article 21 (4). This is especially significant because it is
Pursuant to Article 21 (1) of the General Data Protection Regulation, the Applicant may object at any time
based on Article 6 (1) (f) of the General Data Protection Regulation
whose right, however, can only be exercised in the knowledge of the appropriate information. This
In this case, the outcome of the protest is not automatic but from the process of weighing the interests
depends on the request, the data controller is obliged to prove that with the rights and freedoms of the data subject
other overriding legitimate interests on his side take precedence.
According to Article 21 (4) of the General Data Protection Regulation, the controller is obliged to the data subject
draw their attention to their right to protest at the latest at the latest
at the time of contact and information on this clearly and everything else
should be displayed separately from the information.

16

In view of the fact that the Debtor in the assignment notice sent to the Applicant as
at the first contact regarding the transfer of data, the Applicant did not call
his right to protest and did not provide information on it
clearly and separately from all other information, the Debtor has not complied with the general
Article 21 (4) of the Data Protection Regulation.
III. 2. Legal basis for the processing of the Applicant's personal data
In connection with the transfer of the Applicant's personal data to […]
examined the personal data of the Applicant after the transfer of this personal data
on what legal basis the Debtor continues to store.
According to the document provided by the Debtor to the Authority, the Debtor is the Applicant
full name, birth name, mother's name, place and date of birth, identity card number,
permanent address, vehicle registration number, mailing address, mobile phone number, workplace telephone number
has forwarded its contact details to […], however, the Applicant has provided additional information on this and other
The Debtor still processes his personal data for a number of data processing purposes and on a legal basis.

personal data of the Debtor as described in point I of the explanatory memorandum to this decision
General Data Protection Decree, Pmt., Hpt., Vht., KHR, MNB Decree, and 2/2014. and
a 6/2013. on the basis of the Civil Unity Resolution no.
In the Authority 's view, for the following reasons, only
Article 6 (1) (c) of the General Data Protection Regulation and the related Pmt.
provisions constitute the legal basis for data management or storage.
The Debtor is a Pmt. With regard to Section 56 (1) - (2), the legal relationship of the loan contract
is obliged to keep the Pmt. for eight years from the termination of the Pmt. Section 7 (1)
the personal data of the Applicant processed for the purpose of customer due diligence - or the
documents: ie surname and forename, surname and forename at birth, nationality,
place and date of birth, mother 's birth name, address or, failing that, place of residence, or
the type and number of your identification document. So Pmt. in accordance with the provisions of
The data subject's registration of this personal data of the Applicant is not from a data protection point of view
objectionable.
Additional personal data stored by the Applicant as a higher education institution
education, job title, address, telephone contact, position, date of entry,
monthly proven net income or type of income, registration number of your vehicle, chassis number,
engine number or pedigree number for the processing of personal data neither in the Pmt
the Debtor is not entitled on the basis of the legal acts and legal provisions referred to as the legal basis.
Article 17 (3) (e) of the General Data Protection Regulation provides that
in the case of data processing for the submission and enforcement of legal claims, or
personal data necessary for the protection of the data subject may not be deleted at the request of the data subject.
Article 21 (1) of the General Data Protection Regulation also does not constitute data processing
legal basis, as it provides for the right of the data subject to object.

17

A Hpt. nor do the provisions referred to in Article 1 constitute a legal basis for the processing of personal data, since
those credit institutions ’asset ratings and risk limits and transaction
rules.
A 2/2014. and 6/2013. Civil Unity Resolution No. 1 also does not provide a legal basis for personal
data management. Unity decisions are a means of ensuring uniform application of the law,
which are binding on the courts but do not create a legal obligation to provide personal data
treatment. Data management that fulfills a legal obligation on the controller
it arises from the necessary legislation determining the legal obligation, mainly from law. From this
therefore, unity decisions do not constitute legal bases. The Authority notes
and that the two decisions on legal unity referred to have no data protection implications
does not contain a finding.
Section 5 of the MNB Decree is not a legal basis for data processing either, as it is so-called income-proportionate
installment indicator.
KHR relied on it as a legal basis in relation to his personal data concerning the Applicant's place of work
nor does it constitute a legal basis, given that the processing of such personal data or
the transmission to the central credit information system is not provided for by law.
A Vht. as a court enforcement procedure is also not considered personal data of financial institutions
as a legal basis for its management.
The number, gender and family of the Applicant's driving license refer to the legitimate interest of the Debtor
status, number of people living in a common household, mobile phone number personal information. This is personal
however, the need to process the data was not substantiated by any balancing of interests or otherwise
document, so the Debtor is not entitled to process this personal data of the Applicant either.
In view of the above, the Authority finds that the Applicant is the assignee
personal data (full name, birth name, mother’s name,
place and date of birth, identity card number, permanent address, vehicle registration number,
email address, mobile phone number, telephone contact at work)
in the absence of a data processing purpose and legal basis, the Applicant Pmt. considered not to be preserved by
personal data, in breach of Article 6 (1) of the General Data Protection Regulation.
Following the assignment, the Debtor shall pay the Pmt. In view of the rules of the
surname and first name, birth surname and first name, citizenship, place of birth, time, mother
name of birth, address, if not available, place of residence or type of identification document
and your personal information and the documents containing them. However, the
The Applicant is obliged to use these documents and the personal data contained in the documents
may not perform any data processing operation other than custody, including any legal action
to other authorities arising from their obligations.
Therefore, in the absence of a suitable data processing legal basis for the Debtor after the assignment
must delete the Applicant's highest level of education, job title, address, telephone
availability, position, date of entry, monthly net certified income or
type, driving license number, sex, marital status, number of people living in a joint household,
mobile phone number personal information.
In view of the provisions of the assignment agreement available to the Authority, the Debtor

data, so their processing has not been examined by the Authority.
III. 3. Partial rejection of the application
The Authority rejected the part of the application seeking the prohibition of the Debtor from
to transfer the Applicant's personal data, as it cannot be prohibited in advance in general
transfer of data because it is not possible to determine the purpose and legal basis for this. That's right
their presentation to other authorities arising from possible legal obligations cannot be closed either
Who.
Given that Annex III to the Decision Legal basis for the processing of personal data listed in point 2
Article 6 (1) (c) of the General Data Protection Regulation, and thus at the request of the Applicant
nor may they be deleted in accordance with Article 17 (3) (b) of the General Data Protection Regulation.
Based on the above, Article 17 (3) (b) of the General Data Protection Regulation
The Authority partially rejects the part of the Applicant 's application to order the
Obliged to delete personal data that is subject to mandatory data management.
ARC. Legal consequences
The Authority granted the Applicant's request in part and Article 58 of the General Data Protection Regulation
(2) (b) convicts the Debtor for violating the general
Article 5 (2) and Article 6 (1) of the Data Protection Regulation. The Authority also
ordered by the Applicant pursuant to Article 58 (2) (g) of the General Data Protection Regulation

factors were taken into account:
Infringements by the Debtor under Article 83 (5) (b) of the General Data Protection Regulation

In view of the above, and in view of the fact that based on the Debtor's income statement for 2018, the

and does not exceed the maximum fine that may be imposed.
Based on the above, the Authority has decided in accordance with the operative part.
