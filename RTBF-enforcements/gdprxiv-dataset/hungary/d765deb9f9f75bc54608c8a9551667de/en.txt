findings.
 
In view of the above, in this official data protection procedure, the Authority examined only the
that the processing of the Applicant's personal data after May 25, 2018 is general
whether it was carried out in accordance with the provisions of the data protection regulation.
 
III.1. Data management quality of the Applicants
 
The Authority established from the attached documents that Respondent 1 for Respondent 2
transferred its claim to the Applicant with an assignment contract. His claim
with its assignment, the claim of Respondent 1 was terminated, so after that it is for claim management
could not handle the Applicant's personal data for this purpose. Respondent 2 is the assignee
with the contract regarding the management of the Applicant's personal data is general
has become a data controller according to Article 4, point 7 of the Data Protection Regulation, since the purpose of data management and
Respondent 2 was also authorized and obliged to determine its means.
 
Based on the above, it can therefore be established that it is related to the management of the Applicant's debt
with regard to personal data, the Applicants are separate data controllers, therefore cannot be accepted
Respondent 1's position that since "the assignor and the assignee a

occurred to a third party, so the parties will take any necessary steps in coordination,
could be carried out with the interests of the data subject in mind, thereby reducing the rights of the data subject and
possible risk to your freedoms". According to the Authority's point of view, data protection
the severity of the violation is not affected by the fact mentioned above by Respondent 1, since it
it has no data protection relevance that the Applicants are separate data controllers
economically, what kind of integration are they part of, given that the General Data Protection Regulation
does not differentiate between data controllers with reference to how economic
are related to each other.
 
 
III.2. Data management of Respondent 1
 
Based on Article 4, point 2 of the General Data Protection Regulation, data transmission is also data processing
it counts as.
 
The Authority established from the attached documents that 22.01.2019. on the day of the Applicant 1 a
The Respondent assigned its claim to the Applicant to 2. For concession
with reference to Act V of 2013 on the Civil Code (hereinafter: Civil Code) 6:196.

The Applicant 1 informed the Authority that the above data was provided to the Applicant 2
its transfer is based on the Civil Code 6:193. § (1) and 6:196. § had. The Heir this with that
added that for the data transfer of Respondent 1, Article 6 (1) of the General Data Protection Regulation

Based on the above, therefore, even in the case of assignment, Article 6 (1) of the General Data Protection Regulation

personal data to a third party, including Respondent 2, therefore for such a purpose
data transfer cannot be considered illegal based on the provisions of the General Data Protection Regulation
for data management.
 
The Authority therefore established that Respondent 1 is Article 6 of the General Data Protection Regulation
Based on point f) of paragraph (1), the Applicant had the appropriate legal basis as an individual

However, according to the Authority's point of view, the claim of Respondent 1 is acceptable as a reason a
to the above data transfer, that the claim is the document called the application form and the loan agreement

III.3. Data management of the Respondent 2
 
In order to validate the claim, the Obligor 2 keeps the following data a
Regarding the applicant: the data necessary to identify the data subject (name, birth name,
place and time of birth, mother's name, address, mailing address), regarding the loan agreement
data (contract terms, amount, term, installments), with the amount of the claim
related data (performance, outstanding debt, interest claim, procedural costs), claim
data related to its enforcement (date of termination, claim enforcement procedures,
procedural costs). These data are provided by the Respondent 2 in Article 6 of the General Data Protection Regulation

point f) of paragraph (1), i.e. it is treated with reference to legitimate interest, and the referred sector
also to legal provisions in connection with data management.
 
The above personal data therefore differ from the personal data provided by Respondent 1, as
data on the Applicant's education are not included among the above, a

telephone number, since Respondent 2 declared to the Authority that the data

The Authority in accordance with III.2. with reference to the findings made in point 2 with the data management of the Respondent
In this context, he found that Respondent 2 did not violate the general
Article 6 (1) of the Data Protection Regulation, as the legal basis for the data it manages

and that you have deleted data that is not necessary for asserting your claim, which is common

acted appropriately.
 
 
III.4. Stakeholder application quality of the Applicant's letter and the Applicant 1 herewith
failure to provide information
 
The Applicant attached to his application the letter dated December 12, 2018 - to Applicant 1
addressee - of his letter called "Declaration", as well as the domestic receipt confirming its posting
a copy of the letter sent on February 18, 2019, and proof of its posting
a copy of the return receipt. According to the attached letters, the Applicant objected to the fact that the personal
transfer your data to third parties by the Applicant 1.
 
Contrary to the above, however, Respondent 1 stated that the Applicant is large
submissions received in large quantities were not evaluated as a stakeholder request, and therefore as a stakeholder request
he didn't even answer. At the same time, Respondent 1 also admitted that the large number of submissions
it was a heavy workload for Respondent 1, which was not easy to interpret either
due to repetitions.
 
The Applicant confirmed with a copy of the receipt that it had paid the Applicant 1 the 2018.
letters dated December 12 and February 18, 2019, which clearly
they also contained a stakeholder request, as he objected to the handling of his personal data in them.
 
Pursuant to Article 21 (1) of the General Data Protection Regulation, personal data of the Applicant
as a result of the interested party's request containing his protest against the processing, the Respondent 1 is the Applicant
he could not have processed all his personal data, only those in connection with which he proves
that data processing is justified by compelling legitimate reasons that take precedence
with the interests of the person concerned,
to submit claims,
are related to its enforcement or protection.
 
Based on the above, Respondent 1 should have informed the Applicant of the general
based on Article 12 (3) of the Data Protection Regulation, based on the data subject's request
measures.
 
According to Respondent 1's statement, his failure to respond was caused by unintentional behavior
to the Applicant's stakeholder requests, but this omission can be traced back to the fact that the Applicant
submitted a large number of applications, the classification of which also caused problems. The Authority
according to his point of view, this argument does not exempt Respondent 1 from data controller responsibility,
considering that pursuant to Article 4, Point 7 of the General Data Protection Regulation a
Respondent 1 is considered a data controller. The Respondent 1 is the one who organizes the data management
process and creates its conditions. The most important feature of the data manager is that

Based on all of this, the violation of this decision is the responsibility of Respondent 1, as a data controller

In accordance with Article 12 (1) of the General Data Protection Regulation, the Respondent
1 must clearly inform the Applicant of the measures taken.
 
Based on Article 12 (3) of the General Data Protection Regulation, a decision must be made within one month
to the data subject's request, i.e. to provide information to the data controller with the measures taken
in connection with or in connection with the rejection of the application, so based on this, it is general
adopted as a result of a stakeholder request submitted on the basis of Article 21 (1) of the Data Protection Regulation
about measures.
 
The Authority does not agree with the position put forward by the Legal Successor that the Applicant
submitted and filed as a complaint received by Respondent 1 on December 13, 2018
three lines of the document, which contained no or difficult to interpret reference to it
regarding the fact that the Applicant's data are not transferred to third parties. THE

considering that the complaint is for the mortgage loan number [….] and the residential loan number […]

cannot be interpreted in the context of data transfer. The Authority does not agree with this position,
because the Applicant did not only submit a stakeholder application on December 13, 2018, which the
The applicant also forwarded a copy to the Authority.
 
Furthermore, the Applicant's application dated December 10, 2018 stated as follows:
 
"[...] The revocation also applies to the corresponding contract with invoice number [...]. THE
in my declaration, I forbid the disclosure of my personal data to "THIRD" persons.

The Petitioner's submission entitled "Objection" written on February 18, 2019 contained the following:
 
"I object to the information provided on 02/05/2019..."

I forbid the release of my personal data [...]“

concerned.
 
The personal data were clearly stated in the requests cited above
objection to its handling, so it is clear that it is in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation
Respondent 1 should have submitted it as a stakeholder request and not as a complaint
handle it.
 
Based on the above, the Authority established that Respondent 1 violated the general
Article 12 (1)-(3) of the Data Protection Regulation, since the Applicant did not respond
to your requests, and thus Article 21 (1) of the General Data Protection Regulation
violated by Respondent 1.
 
III.5. Data management of the Applicant 1 and the Legal Successor after assignment, and a
Request for deletion of data by the applicant
 
 
III.5.1. In his statement, the Legal Successor indicated for what purpose and on which legal basis the Respondent 1

According to the Authority's point of view, Pmt. provisions of the personal data below
