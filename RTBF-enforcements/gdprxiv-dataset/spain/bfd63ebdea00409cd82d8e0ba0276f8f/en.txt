III

In the case analyzed here, it has been proven that the claimant exercised her
right of cancellation before the claimed party on November 11, 2016, and his request
did not receive a response, despite the right recognized in article 16 of the LOPD, in force
at the time of the events, a right currently recognized in article 17

On the other hand, the respondent entity states that it had no knowledge of the
change of address of the claimant until November 21, 2016, although the
Respondent states that he communicated it on November 11, 2016.

Despite this, to indicate to the claimant the impossibility of proceeding with the cancellation
of the data included in the ASNEF file as a result of the non-payment of the
service, the respondent entity continued to contact the claimant at the address of the
supply contract, instead of the new one indicated by the claimant, in its
communications dated November 22 and December 22, 2016, that is, with
after the date on which he states that he knows the new address for the purposes of
communications.

Article 26 of Law 40/2015 on the Legal Regime of the Public Sector, establishes that
The sanctioning provisions in force at the time of
events that constitute an administrative infraction occur.

Thus, it is considered that the claimant was improperly included in the
asset solvency files, since the notifications of the prior requirement of
payment, were all returned as absent or unknown addressee, for being
addressed to an incorrect address, as the claimant ceased to reside at that address
since May 2016 and despite having been notified of the change of
address to which the communications should be directed, they continue to address the
address of the supply contract, so you did not receive any of the
prior payment requirements, which implies the violation of articles 38.1 a),
and 43 of the RLOPD that state that "Personal data will be accurate and
updated in such a way that they respond truthfully to the current situation of the
affected”, regulations in force at the time of the infraction.

The application of the RGPD is determined because the maintenance of the address
incorrect constitutes a continuous infraction that lasts over time while
This data quality problem, which caused the infringement at hand, is not
corrective.

Therefore, in the present case there is a violation of article 5.1 d) of the RGPD
because the due payment requirement was not made due to a quality problem of
the data.

IV

Article 72.1.a) of the LOPDGDD states that “according to what is established in the
article 83.5 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 are considered very serious and will prescribe
after three years the infractions that suppose a substantial violation of the
