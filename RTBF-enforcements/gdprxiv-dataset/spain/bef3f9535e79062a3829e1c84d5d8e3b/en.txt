According to the evidence available at this time in
disciplinary procedure resolution, it is considered that the known facts are
constituting an infringement, attributable to FLORAQUEEN, for violation of the
Article 12 of the GDPR, in conjunction with Article 17 of the GDPR.

Classification of the infringement of article 12 of the GDPR

V

The aforementioned infringement of article 12 of the GDPR supposes the commission of the infringements
typified in article 83.5 of the GDPR that under the heading "General conditions
for the imposition of administrative fines” provides:

Violations of the following provisions will be sanctioned, in accordance with the
paragraph 2, with administrative fines of maximum EUR 20,000,000 or,
in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the
total annual global business volume of the previous financial year, opting for
the highest amount:

(…)
b) the rights of the interested parties in accordance with articles 12 to 22; (…)”

In this regard, the LOPDGDD, in its article 71 "Infractions" establishes that:

"The acts and behaviors referred to in sections 4,
5 and 6 of article 83 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, as well as those that result
contrary to this organic law”.

For the purposes of the limitation period, article 74 "Infringements considered minor" of
the LOPDGDD indicates:

"The remaining infractions of a legal nature are considered minor and will prescribe after a year.
merely formal of the articles mentioned in sections 4 and 5 of article 83
of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 and, in particular, the following:
(…)

c) Failure to respond to requests to exercise the rights established in the
Articles 15 to 22 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, unless it results from
application of the provisions of article 72.1.k) of this organic law”.

Penalty for violation of article 12 of the GDPR

SAW

Without prejudice to the provisions of article 83 of the GDPR, the aforementioned Regulation provides
in section 2.b) of article 58 "Powers" the following:

"Each control authority will have all the following corrective powers
indicated below:

(…)
b) send a warning to any person in charge or person in charge of the treatment
when the processing operations have infringed the provisions of the
this Regulation; (…)”

C / Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

sedeagpd.gob.es

10/11

For its part, recital 148 of the GDPR indicates:

“In the event of a minor infraction, or if the fine likely to be imposed
constitutes a disproportionate burden on a natural person, rather than
penalty by means of a fine, a warning may be imposed. should however
special attention should be paid to the nature, seriousness and duration of the infringement, to its
intentional nature, to the measures taken to alleviate the damages suffered,
to the degree of responsibility or any relevant prior infringement, to the manner in which
that the supervisory authority has become aware of the infringement, to compliance
of measures ordered against the person in charge or in charge, to adherence to codes of
conduct and any other aggravating or mitigating circumstances.”

According to the evidence available at the present time of
disciplinary procedure resolution, it is considered that the offense in question
is slight for the purposes of article 83.2 of the GDPR given that in the present case,
taking into account that there is no record in this Agency of FLORAQUEEN for not
having duly attended to the exercise of a right of deletion and that it is
of an "Autonomous" type company, allows to consider a reduction of the fault
in the facts, for what is considered in accordance with the Law, not to impose a sanction
consisting of an administrative fine and replace it by directing a warning to
FLORAQUEEN.

VII

imposition of measures

It is deemed appropriate to order the person in charge to proceed to
certify before this Agency that it has deleted the personal data of the party
claimant and has duly communicated it, as indicated in article 12 of the
GDPR, in accordance with the provisions of the aforementioned article 58.2 d) of the GDPR, according to the
which each control authority may "order the person responsible or in charge of the
processing that the processing operations comply with the provisions of the
this Regulation, where appropriate, in a certain way and within a certain
specified term…”. The imposition of this measure is compatible with directing a
warning, according to the provisions of art. 83.2 of the GDPR.

It is noted that not meeting the requirements of this body could be
considered as an administrative offense in accordance with the provisions of the GDPR,
classified as an infraction in its article 83.5 and 83.6, being able to motivate such conduct the
opening of a subsequent administrative sanctioning procedure.

Therefore, in accordance with the applicable legislation and assessed the criteria of
graduation of sanctions whose existence has been accredited,
the Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency RESOLVES:
