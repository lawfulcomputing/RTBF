this corresponds to the complainant, not being able to know at any time that
That second telephone number provided did not correspond to the owner of the operation.

regulatory provisions dictated in its development and, as soon as they are not

administrative procedures”.

II

The facts revealed materialize in the reception of calls
on the claimant's mobile phone line and text messages requesting a
debt pending payment with the defendant derived from the financing of a vehicle,
that the claimant is unaware of as he does not maintain any legal relationship with the
claimed, which would imply the violation of the regulations on protection
of personal data.

Article 58 of the GDPR, Powers, states:

"2. Each supervisory authority shall have all the following powers

corrections listed below:

(…)
i) impose an administrative fine in accordance with article 83, in addition to or in

the same.

3. Sections 1 and 2 will not apply when the treatment is necessary:

e) for the formulation, exercise or defense of claims”.

Recital 59 of the GDPR states that:

"Formulas must be arbitrated to make it easier for the interested party to exercise their
rights under this Regulation, including mechanisms for requesting
and, where appropriate, obtain free of charge, in particular, access to the data
personal information and its rectification or deletion, as well as the exercise of the right to

And Recital 66 of the GDPR states that:

"In order to strengthen the 'right to be forgotten' in the online environment, the right to

28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es

9/17

rectification, opposition, deletion, limitation of treatment, portability and if not
subject to individual decisions.

Therefore, this right can be exercised before the person in charge requesting the
deletion of your personal data when any of the
circumstances established in article 17 of the GDPR.

However, it should be noted that this right is not unlimited, so
that it may be feasible to withhold removal when treatment is necessary
for the exercise of freedom of expression and information, for the fulfillment of a
legal obligation, for the fulfillment of a mission carried out in the public interest or in
the exercise of public powers conferred on the responsible person, for reasons of
public interest, in the field of public health, for archiving purposes of interest
public, scientific or historical research or statistical purposes, or for the
formulation, exercise or defense of claims.

3. The documentation in the file offers clear indications that
the defendant, violated article 17 of the GDPR, right of deletion, since it was not
attended the same, despite the fact that the defendant alleges the contrary, as evidenced by the fact that
it continued to process the claimant's data.

From the documentation in the file, evidence that the defendant
linked the claimant's mobile phone number to the loan agreement number
***REF.2; loan that had been formalized with ***COMPANY.1, with CIF...,
from 11/04/2015 to 11/05/2021, causing the claimant to suffer from
on 07/22/2020 until 04/19/2021 a harassment, a siege in the form of calls and
SMS messages deposited on your mobile phone demanding payment of a debt
related to the financing of a vehicle, object of the aforementioned loan contract
and that the claimant had never subscribed with the claimed entity with which
neither did nor maintains any contractual relationship.

It should be noted that the person claimed in response to the request for
information sent by the AEPD, dated 02/15/2022, stated “That
consulted our systems, there is no information or documentation in them
any about the person whose data you have provided us. therefore not
It is possible for us to send you the requested information”.

However, on 04/18/2022 the Agency sent the defendant a second
requirement, requesting information on the phone number ***TELEPHONE.1 and in its
response, this time it did reveal that "the telephone number that they provide us works in
our system associated with the loan contract no. ***REF.2 formalized with
***COMPANY.1 with CIF..., on 11/04/2015 and ended on 11/05/2021”.

It must be remembered, as stated in the proven facts, that on 08/25/2020
the claimant himself wrote to the defendant informing him of the harassment that
He had been suffering on his mobile phone line, intimidating him to pay a debt
from the financing of a vehicle and that in case of not paying it
threatened to be included in asset solvency files, commonly
delinquency calls; financing that he stated he was unaware of, indicating "That,
since last July 22 of this year... he has been harassed by the company,

C / Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

10/17

that we are hereby addressing, by means of calls and sending sms to the hotline
phone associated with the number ***TELEPHONE.1, requesting the cancellation of your data
and the answer was that "with the data provided, no person appears as
client of this entity.

One of the main novelties and main concept presented by the GDPR,
It is the principle of proactive responsibility. This principle is defined as the need
that the data controller applies technical measures and
appropriate organizational measures in order to guarantee and demonstrate that the data processing
personal data is in accordance with the Regulations. That is, it is not enough to comply with the
data protection regulations, you must also be able to demonstrate that you are
complying with the regulations.

This principle is included in article 5.2 of the GDPR, which establishes:

"2. The controller will be responsible for compliance with the

provided for in paragraph 1 and able to demonstrate it ("proactive responsibility")."

This principle therefore requires a conscious and diligent attitude towards all
the processing of personal data that is carried out, an attitude that has not existed
in the present case since before the letter sent by the claimant on 08/25/2020
the claimant should have acted with greater diligence and proactivity in order to preserve
your rights in the processing of your personal data and its legitimacy,
quite the opposite of what happened on 04/18/2022 when the AEPD sent him his second
requirement, requesting information related to the telephone number *** TELEPHONE.1
belonging to the claimant.

And that before said actions the defendant had proceeded to erase the
telephone number of the claimant before answering the request, measure is
that should have been carried out in light of the claimant's brief, verifying and
verifying that he was not a client of the entity and that he could not belong to
***COMPANY.1, and from that moment the personal data of the
claimant should not have been treated as the claimant was not legitimized
to do so, for not having the consent or authorization to do so.

4. In the brief of 08/25/2020 in which the claimant informed the defendant
of the harassment to which he was being subjected on his mobile line ***TELEPHONE.1 as
consequence of a debt linked to the financing of a vehicle of which he was unaware
have, requested the cancellation of your personal data exercising the right to
suspension before the person in charge and specified his request stating that:

“- REFRAIN from continuing to require any payment.
- PROCEED TO CANCEL the personal data of our partner

from its internal base.

- PROCEED TO CANCEL or refrain from including the personal data
personnel of our partner of all the patrimonial solvency files since the
They themselves do not respond to a certain debt, expired, much less demandable..."

In accordance with the provisions of article 17 of the GDPR, the claimant
had the right to obtain without undue delay the deletion of their data by the

C / Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

11/17

claimed, especially when said data was being processed illegitimately and
exposing the claimant to an unfair and unfounded situation.

Therefore, with the data transferred by the affected party in his request, the
The defendant should have proceeded with greater responsibility, taking into account what the
claimant was enduring and realizing that messages and calls were being
they were doing to someone who was not forced to suffer it because they were not related
contractual with the entity and not limit yourself to responding "that with the data
provided, no person appears as a client of this Entity", because with those
For the same data, the response was the opposite of the AEPD requirement of 04/18/2022.

According to the statements of the defendant, the aforementioned number of
telephone number was provided directly by the attorney of the legal entity that owns the
loan contract, through your Customer Area, during the course of the relationship
commercial on 07/17/2020; said space is available on the website of the claimant to
that its clients can carry out certain procedures and queries about the
contracts that they maintain in force with the Entity.

In this case, the client of the aforementioned loan contract
modified through this functionality, the pre-existing telephone data (second
contact telephone number), entering the number ***TELEPHONE.1.

Likewise, the defendant has stated that he was not aware that the
owner of the telephone line had contacted the entity for any
medium in order to highlight the situation suffered or has filed a claim
some.

However, such manifestation must decline and cannot be admitted, in light of
the documentation provided; suffice it to point to the claimant's brief and the response
offered to the same dated 09/09/2020 cited above that evidences everything
contrary.

5. Regarding the absence of guilt alleged by the defendant, it is necessary to
point out that the principle of guilt is required in the disciplinary procedure and
Thus, STC 246/1991 considers it inadmissible in the field of administrative law
sanctioning a responsibility without fault.

The Supreme Court (STS April 16, 1991 and STS April 22, 1991)
considers that from the guilty element it follows "that the action or omission,
classified as an administratively sanctionable infraction, it must be, in any case,
attributable to its author, due to intent or imprudence, negligence or inexcusable ignorance”. He
The same Court reasons that "it is not enough...for the exculpation of conduct
typically unlawful the invocation of the absence of guilt" but it is necessary
"That the diligence that was required by the person claiming its non-existence has been used."
(STS January 23, 1998).

In this doctrine abounds then the STC (Second Chamber) 129/2003, of June 30
of 2003, which, citing the previous STC 246/1991, states in its F.J. 8: (...) admission
in our sanctioning administrative law of the direct responsibility of the
legal persons, thus recognizing their infringing capacity, implies that the

C / Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid

www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es

12/17

responsibility is configured on the capacity to infringe and the responsibility,
"that derives from the legal right protected by the norm that is infringed and the need to
that said protection is really effective... and for the risk that, consequently,
The legal person that is subject to compliance with said standard must assume it.
(STC 246/1991, FJ 2). In the present case, having existed probative activity of
charge on the facts that were imputed to the company now appellant, it was her
who was responsible for providing the administrative bodies that have intervened in the
substantiation of the file a principle of proof, however minimal, that
would allow them to think that the violation of the rule was not blameworthy (...)”.

Therefore, the entity has suffered from a serious lack of diligence as
demonstrates that its internal procedures or action protocols were
ineffective and were unable to detect that the data provided by the claimant
and the AEPD, especially its telephone number, were not owned by the real
debtor, ***COMPANY.1, with whom a loan agreement had been entered into and
that non-payment notices continue to be sent to your mobile intimidating you to pay a
debt that was not due.

And with regard to the alleged good faith, it should be noted that the Court
Nacional in its judgments, among others that of 05/24/02, has indicated that "good faith
in acting, to justify the absence of guilt –as is done in the present case-;
suffice it to say that this allegation is enervated when there is a specific duty
surveillance derived from the professionalism of the offender. In this traditional line of
reflection, the STS of March 12, 1975 and March 10, 1978, reject the
allegation of good faith, when the offender has duties of vigilance and
diligence derived from his professional status”.

Lastly, it alleges the claimed error in the legal characterization since it is not
true that there has been a lack of response to the exercise of the right to delete the
concerned and that when the AEPD communicated the claimant's mobile number
was disconnected from ***COMPANY.1, and that such proceeding should be classified as
slight for what the infraction would be prescribed.

In the first place, nowhere is it stated, as the defendant says, that there would be
absence of response since the proven facts themselves include the
response offered to the claimant and to the inspector acting for the claimant; what I know
affirms is that the right was not attended to because the treatment continued despite the
submitted writings (which should have led to the cessation of the
treatment), as evidenced by the fact that they continued to intimidate the claimant with repeated
sms and warnings that in case of non-payment it would be included in delinquency files.

Secondly, it is not true, as stated by the defendant, that until
that the acting inspector did not communicate the mobile number of the claimant was when
the link between the data and the third party, ***COMPANY.1, was discovered, since the
The claimant (his representative) had already communicated this in writing on 08/25/2020.

Therefore, up to three attempts had to be necessary, through two separate
written for the defendant to stop processing the data of the claimant, to give
realized that this was not the debtor and released the link that associated the
mobile number as belonging to the true debtor and client of the company.

From the foregoing it can be deduced that the right of suppression exercised by the
claimant was not dealt with, which implies in a certain way his obstruction, his
impediment, the repeated non-attention to the exercise of the same, considering that such

In accordance with the precepts transcribed, for the purpose of setting the amount of the
sanction of a fine to be imposed in the present case for the violation of article 17 of the
GDPR typified in article 83.5 of the aforementioned Regulation for which it is responsible
to the defendant, in an initial assessment, it is estimated the concurrent
following factors:

As aggravating circumstances:

- The nature, seriousness and duration of the infringement, taking into account the
nature, scope or purpose of the processing operation in question; there is no
to forget that we are facing the infringement of a right of the interested party,
right of deletion, which has not been attended to by the entity, which has meant that
the claimant was summoned to pay a debt that did not correspond to him
causing him damages with the attempt to make him a creditor of a debt that he did not
corresponded and the attempt, produced the non-payment, to include it in files called
commonly delinquency; In addition, the treatment operation has meant that its
data of a personal nature were subject to treatment without any legitimacy by not
demonstrate any legal basis for its treatment.

In addition, the claimant's personal data has been processed
by the defendant, without stating that he is or has been a client of the entity (article 83.2.
a) of the GDPR).

- Although it is not possible to maintain that the entity has acted
intentionally or intentionally, there is no doubt that he has committed a serious lack of
diligence by not attending to the right exercised as evidenced by continuing and
persisted in his treatment as evidenced by the messages issued with
after the exercise of the right (article 83.2. b) of the GDPR).

- The continuous nature of the infringement, since the defendant has been
processing the personal data of the claimant until 04/19/2021; since
The complaint document was sent to him, requesting the deletion of the data from the
claimant should have stopped being processed without any delay (article 76.2.a) of the
LOPDGDD in relation to article 83.2.k).

- The activity of the allegedly infringing entity is linked to the
data processing of both clients and third parties. In the activity of the entity
claimed, it is essential to process the personal data of its
clients and third parties, therefore, given its business volume, the
The significance of the conduct that is the subject of this claim is undeniable.
(article 76.2.b) of the LOPDGDD in relation to article 83.2.k).
