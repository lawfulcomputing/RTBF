However, on 10/16/20, it has entered this Agency, a second
complaint filed by the claimant indicating that the operator was still
sending SMS to his telephone line, and attached the screenshots of more than 60 SMS
received until that day, so he considered that the operator had not attended

profile belongs to another user, but has access to the personal data of this
person, to their invoices, and even has the possibility of carrying out any procedure

claimant in this sanctioning procedure (PS/00448/2020) and of the

by this Agency, set out in point II, it is verified that the known facts
could constitute an infringement, attributable to the defendant, for violation of the
article 17.1.c) of the RGPD, due to breach of the right to delete the data
of the interested party, when he had exercised the right of opposition before the
entity and it had even confirmed that it had correctly managed said
law.

Article 72.1.k) of the LOPDGDD considers it very serious, for prescription purposes,
“The impediment or the obstruction or the repeated non-attention of the exercise of the
rights established in articles 15 to 22 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.”.

This infraction can be sanctioned with a maximum fine of €20,000,000 or,
in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the
global total annual turnover of the previous financial year, opting for the
of greater amount, in accordance with article 83.5.b) of the RGPD.

In accordance with the precepts indicated, and without prejudice to what results from the

has access to this person's personal data, their invoices, and there is even the
possibility of carrying out any procedure with your personal data.

The security of personal data is regulated in article 32 of the RGPD,
where it is established that:

(…)”

The GDPR defines personal data security breaches as “all
those breaches of security that cause the destruction, loss or
accidental or unlawful alteration of personal data transmitted, stored or processed
otherwise, or unauthorized communication or access to such data”.

From the documentation in the file, there are clear indications that the
claimed has violated article 32 of the RGPD, when there was a breach of
security in their systems by sending an SMS to the claimant with the access codes to
the “Mi Yoigo” platform, belonging to another client of the company.

It should be noted that the RGPD in the aforementioned precept does not establish a list of the
security measures that are applicable according to the data that are subject
of treatment, but establishes that the person in charge and the person in charge of the treatment
apply technical and organizational measures that are appropriate to the risk involved
the treatment, taking into account the state of the art, the application costs, the
nature, scope, context and purposes of the treatment, the risks of probability

therefore, incurring in the violation of article 5.1 f) of the RGPD, which establishes the
principles of integrity and confidentiality of personal data, as well as the

claimed entity, of article 21 of the LSSI, which establishes the prohibition of
send advertising or promotional communications, by means of communication
electronically, which had not previously been requested or expressly authorized.

Article 21 of the LSSI, on non-consensual commercial communications,
establishes that:

"1. The sending of advertising or promotional communications by

contracting with the client. In any case, the provider must offer the recipient the
possibility of objecting to the processing of your data for promotional purposes by
a simple and free procedure, both at the time of data collection
as in each of the commercial communications that you direct. When the
communications had been sent by email, said means must
necessarily consist of the inclusion of an email address or other
valid electronic address where this right can be exercised, being prohibited

claimant in this sanctioning procedure (PS/00448/2020) and of the

article 21 of the LSSI, for sending a large number of advertising SMS or
without the authorization of the interested party and after the claimed entity
affirm that they had responded to the request of the interested party not to send him or her

standard, which qualifies as such, "The sending of commercial communications by e-mail

www.aepd.es

electronic or other equivalent means of electronic communication when in said
shipments do not meet the requirements established in article 21 and do not constitute
Serious offense".

Pursuant to the provisions of article 39.1.c) of the LSSI, minor infractions may
sanctioned with a fine of up to €30,000, establishing the criteria for its
graduation in article 40 of the same norm.

After the evidence obtained, and without prejudice to what results from the investigation,
considers that it is appropriate to graduate the sanction to be imposed in accordance with the following
aggravating criteria, established by art. 40 of the LSSI:

-

The existence of intentionality, an expression that must be interpreted as
equivalent to a degree of guilt according to the Judgment of the
National High Court of 11/12/07 relapse in Appeal no. 351/2006,

entity stated that it had agreed not to send any more SMS to the interested party, the

a penalty of 20,000 euros (twenty thousand euros), for the infringement of article 21 of the
LSSI, regarding the sending of commercial communications via SMS without the
consent of the affected.

Therefore, in accordance with the foregoing, by the Director of the Agency
