Violation of the right to erasure. On February 4, 2020 he had the deletion of a

Article on the Respondent's platform at the Internet address

informed not to comply with the request for deletion.

2. In a statement dated April 8, 2020, the Respondent submitted that

the personal data contained in the incriminated editorial contribution

The complainant's claim for cancellation will come to nothing and be the complaint

to be rejected due to the lack of competence of the data protection authority.

3. The complainant brought - according to the parties to the results of the

preliminary proceedings - summarized with a statement of April 15, 2020,

that this standard (§ 9 DSG) is not a license for derogatory remarks ("laughing point")

may be. The presentation would go beyond journalistic purposes. The public

The complainant then lodged a complaint with the

data protection authority. The online article in question was published by

Completion of the procedure not deleted.

Evidence assessment: The findings made are based on the input of the

Complainant dated February 26, 2020 and the submitted correspondence

between the complainant and the respondent.

D. In legal terms it follows that:

1. General information on the media privilege according to Section 9 (1) DSG

In § 9 DSG, the previous data protection law media privilege according to § 48

DSG 2000, Federal Law Gazette I No. 165/1999 as amended to Federal Law Gazette I No. 132/2015, with expanded

Scope transposed into the GDPR system. The national regulation

in § 9 DSG is linked to Art. 85 GDPR, a basic provision including

Opening clause, and expands the scope of the

Privilege on any processing of personal data related to journalistic

(paragraph 1 leg. cit.) or scientific, artistic or literary (paragraph 2

leg. cit.) purposes. One can therefore of a data protection law

Freedom of information privilege (hereinafter only: "privilege") speak (cf. mutatis mutandis

Suda/Veigl in Gantschacher/Jelinek/Schmidl/Spanberger, Data Protection Act1 § 9

Margin no. 1, still with reference to § 9 DSG as amended by Federal Law Gazette I No. 165/1999 as amended by Federal Law Gazette I No. 120/2017

[Data Protection Amendment Act 2018]).

However, the national legislature restricts the privilege under Section 9 (1) DSG,

by making the privilege accessible only to media companies or media services,

if personal data for journalistic purposes by media owners,

Publishers and media workers or employees of a media company

or media service are processed.

Processing of personal data for journalistic purposes follows

the understanding of the ECJ if the processing has the sole aim of

To disseminate information, opinions or ideas to the public (cf. the judgment

of the ECJ of December 16, 2008, C-73/07 - Satakunnan Markkinapörssi and

Satamedia, margin no. 62).

To understand the importance of freedom of expression in a democratic

Society must take into account terms such as journalism, which relate to

refer to this freedom, as a result be interpreted broadly (recital 153 last sentence

GDPR). This means that data is always used for journalistic purposes

processed if the objective is to publish for an indefinite period

group of people

is

(cf. Buchner/Tinnefeld

in Kühling/Buchner, data protection

Basic Ordinance2 Art. 85 margin no. 17).

2. In the matter

For the present case, these considerations mean the following:

For the applicability of the privilege according to § 9 Abs. 1 DSG it makes no difference

Difference whether personal data (offline) in a print medium or (like

objective) are published in an "online daily newspaper" (cf. the

Notification of the DSB of August 13, 2018, GZ: DSB D123.077/0003-DSB/2018).

The Respondent is undisputedly a media company

which as media owner

for the

Content of the online news platform

https://www.n***-digital.net/ ("N*** Digital") is responsible.

In addition, the relevant data of the complainant

in the context of a journalistic article aimed at indefinitely

large group of people about the official behavior of a high official ([function

of the complainant in the hierarchy of the Austrian security authorities]

of the federal state L***), processed and subsequently published.

If the complainant remarks in this context that it is

Denigrations (the complainant was a "laughing stock") act, is him

to counter that the use of such language in the context

the publication of information related to persons - which is classified as "secondary purpose"

aims to provoke or shock – does not harm (cf. ECtHR

February 21, 2012, 32131/08 and 41617/08 [Tuşalp vs. Turkey] marginal number 48, according to which the

Language - although it may be offensive or even shocking - as

stylistic device is in principle also protected by Art. 10 ECHR).

One may arrive at a different assessment if the publication alone

pursues the purpose of willful disparagement, which is not the case here,

because - as already explained above - the public (also) about grievances in the

administration should be clarified.

The data was therefore processed for “journalistic purposes” as defined above

considerations.

Since both requirements (processing of personal data by a

media company for journalistic purposes of the media company).

are, § 9 para. 1 DSG applies.

3. Competence of the Data Protection Authority

The privilege under Section 9 (1) DSG excludes the application of Chapter VI GDPR

("independent supervisory authorities"). Not by privilege

the application of the provisions of Chapter VIII GDPR is excluded

(“Remedies, Liability and Penalties”).

It is true that Art. 77 GDPR (in Chapter VIII) also in the scope

of § 9 Para. 1 DSG and Art. 85 Para. 2 GDPR applies.

However, Chapter VIII cannot be viewed in isolation from Chapter VI, which

in particular, the competence (Art. 55 GDPR) of the supervisory authorities is standardized.

The right of appeal to the data protection authority granted in Art. 77 GDPR is

accordingly, as well as the imposition of a fine by the data protection authority

excluded, especially since the authority to issue orders and impose sanctions

Data protection authority (Chapter VI, in particular Art. 58 Para. 2 lit c and i DSGVO) for

Data processing under the protection of the privilege does not apply (cf. mutatis mutandis

Suda/Veigl in Gantschacher/Jelinek/Schmidl/Spanberger, loc.cit. margin no. 2).

Incidentally, it should be pointed out that the privilege under Section 9 (1) DSG

expressly also the application of the provisions of Chapter III GDPR

("Data subject rights") and thus the exercise of the right to erasure

according to Art. 17 GDPR would not be considered. A legal protection is due

this legal situation only according to the provisions of civil law (in particular according to

the MedienG) possible.

4. Result

Against the background of these considerations, the data protection authority is in the result

not competent to deal with the complaint in question, why

was to be decided according to the verdict (cf. on the lack of jurisdiction in the case of § 9 para. 1

DSG the decision of the DSB of August 13, 2018 aaO and to that extent

Comparable legal situation according to the DSG 2000 the decision of the DSB of June 27th

2016, GZ: D122.455/0003-DSB/2016).
