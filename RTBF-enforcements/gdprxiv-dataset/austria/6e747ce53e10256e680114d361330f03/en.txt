Classifieds portal with more than 4 million users. To register as a user

only a first name and an e-mail address are required. Both

Data would be used in combination as a "unique identifier". The Complainant

now only have the surname "A***" and

the e-mail address "j***@***isp.at". This email address is in the

corresponding data processing of the Respondent, however, neither with the

Surname "A***", still with the first name "Roland", but with the first name

to request proof of identity in the required form. reason for this approach

is not the attempt to be able to identify the highest possible number of users, but

when registering (or when requesting a

new password) had been neglected. He would have been ready at any time

give his wife's first name or the password used, which was used by the

Respondent requested proof of identity by sending a form

with a handwritten signature is even less suitable in comparison,

Dispel doubts about his identity with the authorized user.

The following provisions of the GDPR apply to the exercise of their rights:

"Article 4

Applied to the established facts, it follows that:

14. It is certain that the Respondent in accordance with Art. 4 Z 1 and 2 DSGVO data of

complainant processed. The complainant as user (and

Customer of the Respondent) himself in the data processing of

entered into the (online) system serving the respondent.

15. Since the Respondent, on the occasion of the processing of the data of the

complainant had no intention of identifying the complainant

means the existence and legal identity (conformity) of

Complainant as a natural person (cf. § 16 ABGB, Art. 4 Z 5 DSGVO speaks

also from a "specific data subject") with the created user profile

to check the "online person" shown and corresponding data (e.g

full name details, date of birth or a verifiable home address)

to save, were pseudonymised from the point of view of the Respondent from the beginning

Data according to Art. 4 Z 5 GDPR. It would have been conceivable that the

Respondent has it, however, what from the point of view of the data protection authority

what is crucial is its users as the data subjects of the processing

expressly free to create pseudonymous user profiles by registering with the

Registration did not require any proof of identity. The Respondent has

from the beginning within the meaning of Art. 11 Para. 1 DSGVO on an identification of the

Complainant as a specific data subject is waived. The Complainant

was for them up to the time of the request for deletion, so to speak, only one

Pseudonym, a first name and an e-mail address in their user database.

16. Pursuant to Art. 12 (2) GDPR, the Respondent [editor's note: im

Original as a result of an editorial error "complainant"] the express

Obligation to make it easier for the data subject to exercise the right to erasure, among other things.

The data subject may only be identified to the extent that they

is necessary to verify the entitlement to exercise the right to erasure.

In the present case, the requested deletion of a pseudonymous

user profile, the stored profile data can be used. A pseudonymous user

can, for example, through knowledge of the login data (user ID, password), through information

to the stored data content of the profile or through the proven

Power of disposal over the mailbox, their e-mail address at the time of registration

has been specified. New data (such as first name, surname,

Home address, a copy of an ID card or a graphic image of a handwritten one

Signature) do not have to be collected for this reason (cf. Art. 11 Para. 1

GDPR). Incidentally, these would be used for the intended purpose of identity verification

not suitable, since no comparative data is stored by the respondent,

whose identity (correspondence) is checked against the newly collected data

could. The complainant rightly pointed this out.

17. In the event of a complaint, the complainant would have, for example, through the respondent

may be requested to both parts of the Respondent so

designated "unique identifier", i.e. first name and registered e-mail address

to name.

18. The fact that the Respondent is not satisfied with that, but on the

Filling out an extensive form (which is based on the normal case of processing the

data of identified, non-pseudonymous natural persons) existed,

it has the complainant in his right to erasure according to Art. 12 para. 2 in connection with

Art. 17 para. 1 GDPR violated. This was according to § 24 paragraph 5 sentence 1 DSG

to determine [Editor's note: in the original as a result of an editorial error

"§ 25 Para. 1 1st sentence DSG"].

to be carried out by the complainant. It was to be taken into account that the

Complainant has already proved in the course of the proceedings that both

put was. A period of two weeks seems appropriate and sufficient

to perform.
