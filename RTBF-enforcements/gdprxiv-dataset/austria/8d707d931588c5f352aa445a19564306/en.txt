D. In legal terms it follows that:

1. General information on "media privilege" and the competence of the data protection authority

a) On Art. 85 GDPR

According to Art. 85 Para

Compliance with the requirements according to paragraph 2 and paragraph 3 leg. cit. – the right to protection

personal data under this regulation with the right to

free

expression of opinion and

Freedom of information, including processing

to

journalistic purposes and for scientific, artistic or literary purposes

purposes, in accordance.

b) For the Austrian implementation of Art. 85 GDPR

In § 9 paragraph 1 DSG, the previous data protection law "media privilege" according to § 48

DSG 2000, Federal Law Gazette I No. 165/1999

idF BGBl. I No. 83/2013, with

extended

Scope transposed into the GDPR system. The national regulation in § 9

DSG ties in with Art. 85 GDPR, a basic provision including an opening clause

(cf. Suda/Veigl in Gantschacher/Jelinek/Schmidl/Spanberger, Data Protection Act1 § 9 margin no. 1,

still with reference to § 9 DSG as amended by Federal Law Gazette I No. 165/1999 as amended by Federal Law Gazette I No. 120/2017 [data protection

Amendment Act 2018]).

According to the express legal text of § 9 Para. 1 DSG, two requirements must be met

must be met cumulatively in order to enter the privileged scope:

Firstly, processing of personal data by media owners,

Editors, media workers and employees of a media company or

media service within the meaning of the MedienG and has secondly to this processing

journalistic purposes of the media company or media service.

It is striking that Section 9 (1) DSG contains a restriction to a specific professional group

("classic media companies"), although Art. 85 Para. 2 GDPR such a

restriction is foreign and leg. cit. only to "processing for journalistic purposes"

connects.

The ECJ goes after stRsp in relation to the former Art. 9 of the Directive 95/46/EC - the

The counterpart provision of now Art. 85 GDPR - assuming that in Art. 9 of the directive

95/46/EC exemptions and exemptions not only for media companies,

but apply to everyone who works as a journalist (cf. the judgment of the ECJ of February 14

2019, C‑345/17 [Buivids] para. 52 and the Rsp cited there).

A direct application of Art. 85 Para. 2 DSGVO with non-application of § 9

Para. 1 DSG is ruled out, however, since the first provision is not a material provision,

but only contains the mandate addressed to the Member States

to enact legislation for certain processing situations (cf. Schiedermair in

Ehmann/Selmayr, General Data Protection Regulation Comment2 [2018] Art. 85 margin nos. 1 and 9).

An interpretation of Section 9 (1) DSG in the light of the above-mentioned case law of the ECJ

but would -

in reverse - to

to lead,

any data processing

"journalistic purposes" to the verification control by the data protection authority

revoke. After the stRsp of the EuGH exceptions and limitations have regarding

to limit data protection to what is absolutely necessary (cf. the judgment of the ECJ

of February 14, 2019 loc.cit., para. 64 and the Rsp cited there).

The analogous application of Section 9 (1) DSG to the present facts is also different

out; the restriction to a certain professional group standardized in § 9 para. 1 DSG was in

the originally planned implementation of Art. 85 (2) GDPR domestically

provided (cf. RV 1664 dB XXV. GP, 14.), which is why it is a deliberately restrictive

approach of the Austrian legislator (cf. VwGH 10.10.2018, Ra 2018/08/0189

Rs 4 mwN, according to which the analogy is generally permissible in public law, but that

existence of a genuine legal loophole is assumed).

c) intermediate result

It can therefore be assumed that only if the two requirements of § 9

Paragraph 1 DSG legal protection exclusively by way of the ordinary courts according to MedienG

is possible and the data protection authority is not responsible (cf. the decision of the

DSB of August 13, 2018, GZ: DSB-D123.077/0003-DSB/2018).

In all other cases, the data protection authority is responsible for the treatment of the content

However, within the scope of the consideration, the right to freedom of expression according to Art. 11 EU

GRC or Art. 10 ECHR to be taken into account.

2. In the matter

a) Respondent as "media company"

According to § 1 para. 1 no. 1, a "medium" means any means of disseminating communications

or performances with intellectual content in word, writing, sound or image to a larger one

group of people by way of mass production or mass distribution.

According to § 1 para. 1 Z 6 MedienG, a "media company" is a company in which the

content design of the medium is taken care of as well as its production and distribution (Z 1

leg. cit.) or its broadcast or retrievability (Z 2 leg. cit.) either concerned or

be prompted.

According to § 1 Para. 1 Z 11 MedienG, a "media employee" is an employee who works in a

Media company or media service in the content design of a medium or

contributes to the media service as a journalist, provided that he is an employee of the

Media company or media service or as a freelancer this journalistic

activity constantly and not just as an economically insignificant sideline.

According to the Supreme Court's stRsp, the term media company is fulfilled if the

A company beyond the mere distribution of content – with a minimum

in entrepreneurial structures - is operated, the purpose of which is the

The content of the website is designed by an editorial team and a large number of employees

or freelance media employees (cf. RIS-Justiz RS0129847).

In the literature it is stated that in the field of electronic media, the

Content provider (i.e. the operator of a platform on which information about the use

placed on the web) is covered by the term “media company”. Next will

mutatis mutandis geared to the fact that “[...] the economic organizational unit to whose

Corporate (main) purpose is the content design of the medium, namely

(regularly) by an editorial team and a large number of employees or

freer

Media staff” decisive

is (cf. Koukaul

in Berka/Höhne/Noll, media law:

Practice comment4 [2019] § 1 margin no. 25 with further references).

In a similar case, in which the respondent there –

the representative of the respondent, Dr. Karl R*** - operated a private blog and

has published personal data of the complainant, the applicability of the

Media privilege denied. This is because the operation of the private blog does not include it

it was to be assumed that the standard demanded by the Supreme Court was that of a media company

with regard to the structure is fulfilled (cf. the decision of the DSB of March 4, 2020, GZ: DSB-

D124.1340/0003-DSB/2019, not in the RIS, but known to those involved).

As stated, for the relevant news area at https://verein-

n***.at/presse/news/ However, five people regularly work as editors, there is one

Content/Management/Publishing Team as well as two people as editors-in-chief who

contribution

release.

A total of 68 hours per week are provided by employees of the

Respondent invested in the specified news area.

In the sense of the cited stRsp of the OGH, the respondent not only spreads content in the

connection with animal and environmental protection, but this also has a minimum

Established structures in order to research this content accordingly in advance and

to prepare. The persons working for the Respondent are also regularly and

not only occasionally entrusted with the distribution of content in the news area.

It can remain undecided whether the Respondent with the publication of content

- including the complainant's personal data - intends to profit

(cf. the judgment of the ECJ of December 16, 2008, C-73/07 [Satakunnan

Markkinapörssi and Satamedia] margin no. 59)

It can therefore be assumed that the Respondent in the present case uses the term

of the "media company" according to § 1 Abs. 1 Z 6 MedienG fulfilled.

b) Data processing for “journalistic purposes”

Processing of personal data for journalistic purposes is based on

understanding of the ECJ if the processing has the sole purpose of

To disseminate information, opinions or ideas to the public (cf. the judgment of

ECJ of 16 December 2008, C-73/07 [Satakunnan Markkinapörssi and Satamedia]

para. 62).

For the applicability of the privilege according to § 9 paragraph 1 DSG

is therefore the only one

Processing purpose decisive.

Applied to the present case, these statements mean the following:

The relevant contribution is a report in the

Connection to a court case between a hunter – which is also the subject

the reporting of the respondent was - and the chairman of the

Respondent, Dr. Karl R***.

Mentioning the complainant by name as a witness in this trial is

public interest of relevance, since this is a (former) politician

acts, which (at least in the past) on the board of the D***-P and as a ****speaker

of this party and also worked for the Respondent for a certain period of time (cf. on

public interest in private individuals entering the “political stage”, RIS Justice

RS0115541).

It can therefore be assumed that the publication of the personal data of

complainant in the relevant article a journalistic purpose

pursued.

3. Result

As a result, it should be noted that the Respondent is

i)

in any case

as part of the operation of the news area at https://verein-

n***.at/presse/news/ is a media company according to § 1 Abs. 1 Z 6 MedienG and

that

ii) the objectively relevant publication of the personal data of

complainant

in the

news area

under

https://verein-

n***.at/presse/news/201*/reportsneu*3*1*8*.php for journalistic purposes.

The requirements of Section 9 (1) DSG are therefore met.

As stated above, the data protection authority is within the scope of Section 9 (1) DSG

responsible for dealing with complaints.

The appeal was therefore dismissed in accordance with the verdict.
