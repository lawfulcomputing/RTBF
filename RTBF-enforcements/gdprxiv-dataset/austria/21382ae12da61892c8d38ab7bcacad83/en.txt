The complaint turned out to be unfounded.

Procedural Note

14

The complaints procedure according to Art. 77 GDPR is, in particular in the Austrian

procedural design by § 24 DSG, by a party application, the

Complaint, initiated adversarial multi-party proceedings,

in which the

Data protection authority must decide by decision, to the extent and as long as complaint

present. The latter is the case and the cessation requested by the Respondent

of the procedure is therefore not considered here.

Respondent as a scientific institution

15

The Respondent is a scientific institution according to § 2b Z 12 FOG, since it

as a non-profit organization (foundations according to BStfFG are according to § 1 Abs. 1 BStfFG per

by definition, either "non-profit" or "charitable", with the latter already being absent

corresponding assertion is ruled out) carries out research activities. From the

public financing of the Respondent is the public interest in their

Activities can be derived.

16

In the opinion of the data protection authority, the management of the so-called "cutting archive" falls

under data processing for an archiving purpose in the public interest

Article 89 (3) GDPR. The appellant's contrary allegation that

Respondent is pursuing "current political purposes" and is therefore not scientific

active, not applicable. For this it would have to be proven that the archive management exclusively

political goals that the complainant did not describe in detail

to be useful. However, there was not even one for the inclusion of such evidence

sufficiently substantiated statement of fact. That the Respondent

takes a basic political stance that can be deduced from its name and always does so

expresses it publicly again, harms the scientific purpose of the

Activity of the Respondent, however, not.

Research privilege according to § 2d Abs. 6 FOG:

17

The Respondent cannot, contrary to its submissions, refer to the

flat-rate protection of § 2d para. 6 Z 3 FOG, which requires a deletion of

excludes personal data from archives of scientific institutions.

18

Section 2d FOG reads in part including the heading:

“Basic provisions on the protection of personal data

§ 2d. (1) […]

(6) The following rights do not apply insofar as this enables the achievement of
Purposes according to Art. 89 Para. 1 DSGVO probably made impossible or seriously
is affected:

1.[…]

3. Right to erasure or right to be forgotten (Art. 17 GDPR),

[...]

6. Right to object (Art. 21 GDPR).”

 

19. Pursuant to Article 1 Paragraph 3 Z 1 FOG, this federal law regulates the framework conditions

for

Processing (Art. 4 Z 2 GDPR) for archiving purposes in the public interest

scientific or historical research purposes and for statistical purposes

Within the meaning of Art. 89 Para. 1 GDPR.

20

Section 2d (6) FOG is, among other things, one in Art. 89 (3) GDPR

(Opening clause) fundamentally provided national special provision in favor of

archiving purposes in the public interest.

21

violates this provision

however accurate

in

that point on which the

Respondent bases, paragraph 3, against the wording of Art. 89 Para. 3 GDPR, which

nationally defined exceptions to the right to erasure (“to be forgotten”)

Art. 17 GDPR expressly does not provide for data processing for archiving purposes.

22. In accordance with the principle of the primacy of application of Union law (cf. ECJ, judgment of

March 9th, 1978, C-106/77 – Simmenthal II) § 2d Abs. 6 Z 3 FOG does not apply here

remain.

23. In principle, according to Art. 17 GDPR, data can also be deleted

Processing is required for archiving purposes in the public interest

pursue.

Extended legality check of data processing

24

It therefore remains to be considered whether an application of the right to erasure

("Being Forgotten")

according to

Article 17 GDPR

the

right to erasure

of

able to substantiate the complainant.

25. Pursuant to Art. 17 Para. 1 GDPR, one of the

in

lit a to f listed

cancellation requirements are met.

26

In accordance with lit c, an objection by the complainant against the

Processing of his data (under the logical-systematic assumption that an application for

Deletion always includes an objection to data processing) or

according to lit d the lack of a lawful basis for data processing.

a. Legal bases of the data processing of the respondent

27

The Union legislators (Council and Parliament) see several exceptions to stricter ones

Rules of the GDPR for archiving purposes in the public interest and thus bring

to express that archiving is in principle a permissible form of

data processing is. News and press archives, such as the "Schnittarchiv", are available

Furthermore, under the special protection of Art. 11 GRC (GDPR, recital 153).

28

On the admissibility of data processing

for

in public

interest

lying

Article 5 paragraph 1 lit. b and e GDPR also refers to archiving purposes.

29

Art. 9 Para. 2 lit. j GDPR allows the processing of special categories of data, under

other things to the political beliefs of a data subject, on the basis of

Union law or the law of a Member State which is proportionate to that

objective pursued, respects the essence of the right to data protection and is appropriate

and specific measures to safeguard the fundamental rights and interests of data subjects

Person provides, for archival purposes in the public interest, for scientific

or historical research purposes or for statistical purposes pursuant to Art. 89 Para. 1

GDPR.

30. Pursuant to § 7 Para. 1 Z 1 DSG, the person responsible may act in the public interest

Archival purposes, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical

Purposes that do not aim for personal results, all personal

Process data that is publicly available.

31. According to § 7 Para. 2 Z 1 DSG, data processing for purposes in the public interest

lying archival purposes, scientific or historical research purposes or

Statistical purposes that do not fall under paragraph 1, personal data, etc. according to

special legal regulations are processed.

32

Section 2f FOG reads in part including the heading (underlining by the

Data Protection Authority):

"Data basis for activities for purposes according to Art. 89 Para. 1 DSGVO

§ 2 f. (1) Scientific institutions (§ 2b Z 12) may research material (§ 2b Z 6)
collect, archive and
systematically record and process all data (§ 2b Z 5) that are required,
to optimal access to data (§ 2b Z 5) and research material for purposes according to
Art. 89 Para. 1 GDPR (“Repositories”), such as in particular:

1. Names according to § 2g Para. 2 Z 1,

[…]

5. Other data required for archiving and classification, such as
Location data or information pursuant to § 2g Para. 2 Z 1 and 2 on persons who
have provided research material, as well

6. further information, such as in particular:

a) political background information […]”

 

33

From the quoted provisions of § 2 f paragraph 1 FOG it follows that the

Respondent has a sufficient legal basis to conduct the

“Cutting Archives” available.

34

The reason for deletion according to Art. 17 Para. 1 lit. d DSGVO is therefore not available. Union law

also covers, together with the supplementary national law, the processing of special

Categories of data for archival purposes in the public interest, including “political

Background information” on individuals who are the subject of archived documents.

In any case, a categorization that, as is the case here, is a discovery of

Media reports allowing the complainant a

"national" or

attribute "German-national" attitudes.

b. Existence of an effective objection

35

Finally

It must be examined whether the respondent has raised an objection to the

Complainant had to be observed, who, according to Art. 17 (1) (c) GDPR, also in

Result would lead to an obligation to delete, being from the logical-systematic

It can be concluded from the context of the last provision cited that this is not only for the

Objection according to Art. 21 Para. 1 or 2 DSGVO, but also for those according to Para. 6 leg.

cit. must apply.

36

The only question here is an objection in accordance with Art. 21 (6) GDPR, which

Special provision the objection to data processing for the purposes specified in Art. 89 para. 1

GDPR mentioned processing purposes.

37. Pursuant to Article 21(6) GDPR, the data subject has the right, for reasons that

result from their particular situation, against the processing that concerns them

relevant personal data that are scientific or historical

Research purposes or for statistical purposes in accordance with Art. 89 Para. 1, objection

object, unless the processing is necessary to fulfill a public interest

underlying task required.

38. As is made clear in particular by recital 156 on the GDPR, it should

Member States may be allowed under certain conditions and subject to appropriate

Guarantees for data subjects Clarifications and exceptions in relation to the

Right to erasure and objection to the processing of personal data to im

archival purposes of public interest, for scientific or historical purposes

research purposes or for statistical purposes.

39

The right of objection according to Art. 21 Para. 6 DSGVO is a relative right of objection that

must be justified. According to Art. 21 Para. 6, the person responsible can object

refuse if the processing is for scientific, historical or statistical purposes

purposes to fulfill a task in the public interest (see above

Haidinger in Knyrim, DatKomm Art. 21 GDPR (status October 1, 2018, rdb.at), margin nos. 2 and margin no. 45 f).

40

The complainant has to justify his objection or request for deletion

summarized, the Respondent does not process data

Archive purposes or scientific and historical research purposes, but

use this data or have it in a press release from [note editor:

Date truncated for reasons of pseudonymization] 2018 - which is claimed to be

the Respondent, however, to the statement of a scientific employee of the

Respondent acted towards a media service - used to

Damaging public reputation and exerting "daily political influence".

41. Whether this is or was the case could remain undecided because the use of archive data,

according to § 2 f paragraph 1 no. 6

lit. a FOG expressly with attachment

"political

Background Information” may be processed for such purposes the public

interest in this data processing cannot be waived (see also above). To the

Complainant would do so to protect his legally protected interests in this regard

freely, against the statement (media report, press release, statement

towards a media employee or media service, content of an interview or similar) with the

to proceed by means of civil and media law.

42

However, the complainant has not been able to raise a reasonable objection

to provide evidence which would have shown that the processing was carried out by the complainant

relevant data for scientific, historical or statistical purposes

Fulfillment of a task in the public interest is not required.

43

Therefore, the Respondent also requested the deletion of the Complainant's data

on the basis of the right of objection in accordance with Section 21 (6) GDPR

declined.

44

The appeal was therefore dismissed accordingly.
