Legal basis: Section 24 (5) of the Data Protection Act – DSG, Federal Law Gazette I No. 165/1999 as amended; §§ 1

Para. 1, 7 Para. 3, 50a ff Data Protection Act 2000 (DSG 2000), Federal Law Gazette I No. 165/1999 as amended to Federal Law Gazette I

No. 83/2013; Art. 17 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (General Data Protection Regulation – GDPR), OJ.

No. L 119 of 04.05.2016, p. 1.

A. Submissions of the parties and course of the proceedings

REASON

1. With a submission dated January 4, 2019, the complainant lodged a complaint with the

Data Protection Authority and submitted the following: The Respondents lead to

AZ: *3 C *31/18r against the complainant termination proceedings related to an apartment in

1*** Vienna, T***gasse 6*, Top *3b. In this case, the Respondents argued that

the complainant had moved out of this apartment for several decades and therefore no

have an urgent need to live in the apartment. In support of this argument, the

Respondents submitted that they had installed a video camera since September 2017

in order to be able to document that the complainant no longer lived in the apartment.

By means of this monitoring, a table was then created which shows the incoming and outgoing

 

should represent the complainant.

The subject matter is an interference with the fundamental right to data protection

video surveillance. The video surveillance was carried out by a video camera in front of the apartment

of the complainant had been attached, at least since September 2017 up to and including May

2018. In the Respondents' preparatory brief of September 28, 2018, under

Point 4 clearly stated that this "in September 2017 in the stairwell a video camera

attached”. A lawful purpose for video surveillance is only under the conditions

of § 12 para. 2 and para. 3 DSG, this requires above all the consent of the person being monitored or

an important interest ahead. This is not the case in the present case, since the monitoring is solely and

served the sole purpose of monitoring the complainant and subsequently his

Track stays in the apartment. General protection has surveillance

in any case not served, since the complainant's apartment had only been specifically monitored

and not the stairwell in general to protect against possible burglars. Next show the

Documentation that the surveillance is personal – namely to the complainant

limited - had taken place. The designation "M" should obviously identify the tenant. the

corresponding + or - next to the "M" would mean entering or leaving the apartment

represent. It is precisely documented here on which day and at what time the

complainant entering and leaving the apartment. In own notes in the table

would the applicant's activities be recorded, such as the removal of

plants or the microwave.

It follows from a further preparatory statement by the Respondent dated

December 12, 2018 clearly that the relevant video recordings exist.

The data protection authority may determine the violation of the fundamental right to data protection, in any case

impose a penalty within the meaning of the GDPR and the deletion of the personal data

Instruct.

The two aforementioned preparatory briefs on the

Dismissal proceedings before the district court W***. In the brief of December 12, 2018 is

documentation of the days and times at which the complainant enters the home

or leaves again.

2. In their statement of January 31, 2019, the respondents stated that the video surveillance

using a technical image recording device was at least from September 2017 to May 2018.

The image recording device was removed on May 16, 2018 and the video surveillance ended. the

The data protection violation alleged by the complainant therefore came into force before the beginning of the validity period

of the GDPR and the entry into force of the Data Protection Adaptation Act 2018 and is

also completed before this date.

According to Section 69 (5) DSG, violations of the Data Protection Act 2000 that occurred at the time of

entry into force of the Data Protection Amendment Act 2018 have not yet been made pending

to assess the legal situation of the DSG as amended, so that in principle the provisions of the DSGVO

 

are applicable (§ 4 Abs. 1 DSG idgF).

Complainant intended to rely on a right of entry into Ms

Marianne A*** to be appointed in accordance with Section 14 (3) MRG, although the requirements for this are not met

passed. In order to substantiate this suspicion, the second respondent, in consultation with

the first respondent hired a private detective to find out where the complainant was

live. This did not provide any concrete investigation results. The second respondent has

then decided to install video surveillance to verify whether the

Complainant actually resides in Apartment Top *3b and, if applicable,

to be able to document that this is not the case. After the passing of his mother on March 18, 2018

the absolutely protected legal interests of the complainant under no circumstances outweigh and - in particular

with regard to the application of more lenient means - the proportionality is not given. It lies

therefore in any case an inadmissible image recording.

It is unclear whether the Respondents ended the images of interest in the subject matter

to have. The complainant encloses a photograph in this regard with his statement and leads

to the fact that an object could be seen on this, which was on the apartment door of the daughter of the

B. Subject of Complaint

The subject of the complaint is the question of whether the respondents to the complainant

Furthermore, the object of the complaint is the question of whether the complainant is in his right to erasure

C. Findings of Facts

The Respondents each own half of the property EZ *45, KG *****, BG W***

Evidence assessment: This results from the insofar undisputed submissions of the Respondents in

 

their statement of January 31, 2019.

The Respondents had a video camera on them at least from April 6, 2017 to May 16, 2018

The recording range of this camera can be seen in the following image:

can be represented.]

The door visible in the picture must be passed through to get to the apartment, among other things

to reach Top *3b. The tenant of this apartment was, until her death, the mother of

complainant.

Assessment of evidence: These findings are based on the submissions of the respondents in their

Statement of January 31, in which you can see the photo above, which the

Shooting range of the camera shows submitted. They also stated, on April 6, 2017, that

this does not appear with sufficient probability.

The video camera was installed to prove that the applicant died before

his mother did not live with her in the same household in the same apartment and him

no right of entry according to § 14 para. 3 MRG and the respondents therefore have a right to

Termination of the rental agreement according to § 30 Para. 2 Z 5.

There are two procedures between the complainant and the respondents before the

District Court W*** (to the AZen: *4 C *46/18b and *3 C *31/18r) pending.

Evidence assessment: This results from the synopsis of the submissions of the parties to the proceedings and

the complaint of January 4, 2019 settled regarding the existing proceedings

The Respondents intend to use the data obtained through video surveillance by

legally binding settlement of the before the district court W*** to the AZen: *4 C *46/18b and *3 C *31/18r

not to delete pending proceedings.

Evidence assessment: This results from the submissions of the Respondents in their statement of

January 31, 2019.

The decision to carry out video surveillance was made by the second respondent

Evidence assessment: These findings are based on the credible information provided by the

Documentation has been prepared showing which days and which dates

times the complainant enters and leaves the home. The documentation captures the

Months September 2017 to March 2018. For each month there is a table in which activities

of the complainant are recorded, such as "Removal Microwave" or

"Halloween Party".

Evidence assessment: These findings are based on the complaint of January 4, 2019

D. In legal terms it follows that:

On the applicable legal situation:

According to Article 99(2), the GDPR became generally effective on May 25, 2018

applicable ("valid"). A retrospective application to matters prior to that date

have occurred and have already been completed, the GDPR - as set out below - is not applicable

remove:

Art. 99 GDPR is according to paragraph 2 leg. cit., like all parts of the regulation, in all member states

binding and immediately valid. The provision therefore stands in accordance with the as fundamental

The principle of the primacy of application of Union law that applies to the interpretation of the Treaties

against any national law that contradicts it (cf. ECJ, Rs 6/64,

1964 ECR, p. 1251 – Costa/ENEL, ECLI:EU:C:1964:66, etc.). Unclear national legislation

in turn, are to be interpreted in accordance with Union law (cf. ECJ, case C-106/89, ECR 1990, p. I-04135 -

Marleasing, etc.). Art. 99 GDPR is an “acte claire” within the meaning of the

Case law of the ECJ (see especially ECJ, October 6, 1982, case 283/81, ECR 1982, 3415 - CILFIT,

etc.), ie. a provision of which there can be no doubt.

Section 69 (4) and (5) sentence 1 DSG therefore states in an interpretation of the provision that conforms to Union law that

from May 25, 2018 decisions of the data protection authority and the Federal Administrative Court,

which have a performance and legal effect (e.g. regarding an illegal

omitted data deletion), the substantive provisions of the GDPR and the DSG

foundations are to be laid.

An interpretation according to which these provisions also apply to decisions relating to the determinations

include events in the past that have had their effects completed,

would be applicable, in any case, Union law prohibits events insofar as, as in the present case, events

are to be assessed before May 25, 2018, since the Union legislature the temporal scope of the

GDPR, as set out above, made binding for all Member States and all subjects

 

has.

The video surveillance took place until May 16, 2018 and thus before the GDPR came into force

and the entry into force of the Data Protection Adaptation Act enacted to implement the GDPR

instead of.

The complaint about violation of the right to secrecy is thus procedurally correct

new legal situation (DSG as amended from Federal Law Gazette I No. 165/1999 as amended from Federal Law Gazette I No. 120/2017) in accordance with Article 24, Paragraph 5

DSG to decide. In terms of substantive law, however, the matter is based on the legal situation at the time of the

Video recordings, thus according to the provisions of the DSG 2000, Federal Law Gazette I No. 165/1999 as amended up to

Federal Law Gazette I No. 83/2013, why on the basis of the meeting led by the respondents

The problem of the compatibility of § 12 DSG with the GDPR will not have to be discussed in detail.

On the other hand, regarding the complaint, you have the right to deletion, against the background of § 24

Para. 6 DSG, the substantive provisions of the GDPR should be used.

Regarding point 1:

The alleged infringement (here: the allegedly inadmissible video surveillance of the

Complainant) is not attributable to the first respondent, since she is not the

Client, i.e. the person who, according to § 4 Z 4 DSG 2000 "alone or together with others,

made a decision to use data” (here: video surveillance) was.

Rather, the investigative procedure revealed that the data protection client was only

Second respondent is. This has - albeit in consultation with the first respondent -

the decision to carry out the video surveillance was made and about the application

upcoming system as well as the location and manner of installing the

Video surveillance system decided. Furthermore, had control of the video camera and

the data stored on the digital recorder was only ever shared with the second respondent.

The complaint against the first respondent was therefore already for this reason in accordance with the verdict

to reject.

Regarding point 2:

In § 50a paragraph 1 DSG 2000 video surveillance is defined as the systematic, in particular

continuous detection of events affecting a specific object (monitored object) or a

affect a specific person (monitored person), through technical image recording or

image transmission devices.

In any case, this applies to the camera that is the subject of the proceedings and was

Parties to the proceedings also not questioned.

If people are also recorded by video surveillance, personal (image) data iSd

DSG 2000 - according to § 4 Z 1 DSG 2000, identifiability is already sufficient - and it is therefore included

Intervention in the right to secrecy according to § 1 paragraph 1 DSG 2000 (Dohr/Pollirer/Weiss/Knyrim,

DSG² § 50a, as of November 26, 2015, rdb.at; cf. also the judgment of the ECJ of December 11, 2019,

 

C-708/18).

As noted, the video camera captured the aisle area in front of the door, which necessarily

has to be walked through to get to Apartment 1*** Vienna, T***gasse 6*, Top *3b.

As the Respondents themselves indicate and it was also established that

Appellant actually made and stored video recordings. It's a thing

interfering with the complainant's right to secrecy.

In a second step, it must be examined whether the encroachment on the right to secrecy is justifiable

is. The legislature has in particular in § 50a DSG 2000 - in the light of Art. 7 lit. f of the directive

95/46/EG is to be interpreted (cf. again the judgment of the ECJ of December 11, 2019) - the

Video Surveillance by Private Declared Allowed for Certain Purposes.

The installation of a camera (with or without a motion detector) in front of the entrance area

Dwelling with the intention of storing digital image data of the people entering this dwelling

and leave, and may use this data as evidence in a court dismissal dispute

use (termination of the lease for the important reason of § 30 para. 2 no. 4

MRG), is a video surveillance according to § 50a DSG 2000, since it is the systematic

Determination of events affecting a specific object (apartment) by a technical

image capture device.

However, the video surveillance in question proves to be disproportionate and therefore

unlawful:

As the ECJ emphasizes in the already cited judgment of December 11, 2019, each

Data processing based on Article 7 lit. f of Directive 95/46/EC (such as video surveillance in

private area), on the principle of data minimization according to Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. c of the Directive 95/46/EG

to be measured (cf. margin no. 47 f of the judgment).

However, it cannot be said that a - secret - video surveillance spread over several

Months and meticulously recorded when the complainant walks through a door and partially

the purpose for which this is done corresponds to this principle.

In this respect, this circumstance already leads to the fact that § 50a DSG 2000, interpreted in the light of Art. 7 lit. f

of Directive 95/46/EC, cannot be used as a legal basis (cf. again the

Judgment of December 11, 2019, margin no. 40 and margin no. 48 f).

Apart from that, such video surveillance is also not permitted because the extraction

of evidence for a civil dispute under any of the lawful grounds for such a dispute

Intervention in the right to secrecy of the persons concerned falls, which is exhaustive in § 50a para. 3 and 4 DSG 2000

are listed (arg "exclusively" in § 50a para. 4 DSG 2000).

Another legal basis, in particular within the meaning of Section 8 (3) DSG 2000, does not come into play

Consider and is also not apparent.



From the existence of a civil emergency within the meaning of § 1306a ABGB, which is a "dangerous

Situation” (cf. OGH E 10. 5. 1979, 8 Ob 50/79, ZVR 1980/277 S 280, RS0027175), can in

There is no question of a mere lack of evidence (cf. the decision of the data protection authority of

August 22, 2014, DSB-D215.463/0006-DSB/2014; cf. further the decision of the Supreme Court,

RIS RS0132122).

Regarding point 3:

As noted, the Respondents continue to store personal data of the

complainant, which they generated through the video surveillance that was carried out.

In accordance with Article 17 GDPR Paragraph 1 lit. d, a person responsible has a data subject

to delete personal data immediately upon request if they are processed unlawfully

will.

As already explained, in the course of the video surveillance of the complainant, a

unlawful data processing of his personal data, which is why this in principle

would be deleted.

In the specific case, however, Art. 17 (3) lit. e GDPR must be observed, which states that Art

Para. 1 and 2 DSGVO do not apply if the processing is for the assertion, exercise or

Defense of legal claims is required.

In terms of time, the regulation applies in any case if the assertion, exercise or

Defense of legal claims is already taking place or is imminent (cf. Herbst in

Kühling/Buchner, General Data Protection Regulation, Art. 17, margin no. 83).

The findings show that two civil court proceedings are pending before the BG W***

are, which deal with inventory disputes. The personal data of

complainants, which were obtained through video surveillance, are evidence in

these procedures, which is why this data does not have to be deleted for the time being.

Regarding point 4:

It should be noted that a subjective right to initiate criminal proceedings against a

certain persons responsible cannot be derived from Art. 77 Para. 1 DSGVO or § 24 Para. 1 and 5 DSG

and in addition, according to Section 25 (1) VStG, the principle of official expediency applies (cf. Fister in

Lewisch/Fister/Weilguni [editors], VStG comment2 [2017] § 25 margin no. 1).

Administrative penal proceedings can therefore only be initiated by a person concerned

However, there is no entitlement to such an initiation.

It was therefore to be decided accordingly.
